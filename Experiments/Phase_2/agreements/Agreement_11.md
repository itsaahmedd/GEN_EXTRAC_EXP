grounds to suspect that the Tenant is in serious breach of this tenancy agreement, in which case

the Landlord may serve a notice on the Tenant (and any other occupiers) requiring corrective
action and if that corrective action is not taken (within any reasonably specified timescale), the
Landlord may have the work carried out and re-charge the cost (or a fair proportion of the cost
where the work concerned is the responsibility of several occupiers) to the Tenant. In addition
to the cost of the work, the Landlord may charge an administration fee equivalent to 10% of the

cleaning charges is available from the Landlord on request.

date of the transfer. Once the transfer is complete, the Landlord has no further liability to the
Tenant for the return of the Damages Deposit.
5.7. The Landlord’s liability for loss or damage to person or property is excluded to the fullest extent
permitted by law unless the loss or damage is caused by (respectively) the Landlord’s negligence,
breach of statutory duty or breach of obligation in this tenancy agreement (which includes the
acts or omissions of (respectively) the Landlord’s employees).
5.8. The Landlord is not liable to repair any damage caused by the Tenant (or their visitor) unless and
until the cost is met by insurance or by the Tenant (any excess on the policy being payable by the

statutory obligation to repair the Landlord may nevertheless claim the cost of doing so from the
Tenant where it was the Tenant who caused the need for repair. If the Landlord (acting
reasonably and after proper investigation) is persuaded that the Tenant (or their visitor) caused
damage deliberately or recklessly, the Landlord may claim the cost of repair from the Tenant
instead of claiming against insurance.

article which constitutes an obstruction or a fire or health or safety risk or which (in the
Landlord’s reasonable opinion) is likely to cause damage to the Building but (unless

on the termination of the tenancy agreement (if earlier) (proper and reasonable removal
and storage costs being payable by the Tenant).
5.9.2. The Landlord will not be an involuntary bailee. This means that any item left at the
Accommodation and/or in the Building by the Tenant at the end of the Tenancy Period
shall be treated as having been permanently abandoned and the Landlord is entitled to
remove, dispose of or sell any such item. At the end of the Tenancy Period, the Landlord
shall have no responsibility to take care of any item the Tenant leaves at the
Accommodation and/or in the Building, return it to the Tenant or account to the Tenant
for the value of any such item.
5.10. To accept delivery of the Tenant’s parcels and mail during reception open hours. The Landlord
will not accept anything it thinks may contain offensive, dangerous, illegal or illicit material
and/or anything that is too big or heavy for the Landlord to store. The Landlord will not be liable
for any loss or damage to the Tenant’s parcels and mail.
5.11. At the start of the Tenancy Period, to make sure that the mechanical and electrical appliances
within the Accommodation are clean and in good working order. The Landlord will maintain such
items in the same condition so long as the repairs are needed as a result of reasonable wear and
tear. Should the damage be a result of misuse by the Tenant, the Tenant will be held responsible
for the cost of the repair.
5.12. The Landlord can suspend or withdraw Services (having given the Tenant prior notice where
possible, unless it is a case of emergency) if the Landlord considers it necessary to do so, to allow
the Landlord to carry out repairs or alterations. The Landlord will not be liable for any costs,
expenses, losses, liabilities, damages or actions that occur as a result of doing so.
5.13. To enter the Accommodation, having given at least 24 hours’ notice, to show prospective tenants
