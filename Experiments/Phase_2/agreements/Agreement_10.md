-----

serious change in personal circumstances (supporting documentation will be
required).

7.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the College shall have the right to

Premises.

7.5 Where Gross Misconduct is alleged which breaches the terms of this Agreement, the
rules and regulations laid down in the Student Disciplinary Procedure and any further

have the right to exclude the Tenant from the Premises during the Disciplinary Process
and any subsequent Appeal. There will be no entitlement to a refund of the fees paid for

occupation of the Premises in accordance with either Conditions 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 above,
the Tenant's obligation to pay the Rent and any other sums due under this Agreement
will nonetheless continue unless and until the College re-lets the Room on a permanent
basis to a new tenant and you will be so liable, even if the Tenant is no longer in
occupation of the Room. If either of the foregoing events occurs and the Tenant has paid
Rent in advance for a period following the date of such termination, the College shall be
entitled to hold such advance payment of Rent and to apply it towards offsetting any loss
suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement.

equivalent of one week's rent from the outstanding amount.

procedures. The appeals procedure is set out in the Student Disciplinary Procedure.

Tenant's obligations under the Tenancy Agreement. If the Tenant does not pay the Rent
and/or perform and observe the Tenant's obligations, the Guarantor (jointly and severally
if more than one) will do so instead, and will reimburse the College for any losses,
damages, costs, and expenses suffered by or incurred by the College as a result. The

**Payment Schedule (International/Overseas Students):**

Once you accept your offer of a room in our Residences, you will receive an invoice for the
full year amount. You can choose to pay the entire amount upfront all at once prior to
moving in. Or alternatively you can pay across 2 instalments, at the start of each semester,
as follows:

The first payment for semester one’s rent is due by 20th August 2023.

The second payment for semester two’s rent is due by 10th January 2024.

The instalment rate is in place to spread equally the amount due for the entire year and
to help you budget accordingly. It does not necessarily reflect the weekly rate, however
the overall total due is the same.
