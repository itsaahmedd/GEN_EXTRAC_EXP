###### 1.7 Any provision of this Agreement which is held by any

occupiers of the Development for damage caused to any

communal or shared areas in the Development and the

Landlord reserves the right to pursue the Tenant for

Any reference to Tenancy refers to the tenancy created

under this Agreement.

###### 1.10 A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a

reference to it as it is in force for the time being, taking

account of any amendment, extension, or re-enactment

and includes any subordinate legislation for the time being

in force made under it.

###### 2. Grant of tenancy & Inventory

 2.1 At the request of the Guarantor, the Landlord lets the

from additional facilities and services, without having to

pay the Tenant any compensation.
