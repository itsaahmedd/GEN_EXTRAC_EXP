**3** **Grant of Lease**

3.1 The Landlord agrees to grant and the Tenant agrees to accept a lease of the Room together with a right to use in common
with others the Flat and the Shared Areas for the Residential Period at the Rent on the terms and conditions set out in this
agreement.

3.2 Where you take occupation of the Room and collect the keys for the Room without having signed and returned this
agreement, you shall be deemed to have accepted the tenancy on the terms and conditions as are set out in this
agreement by the act of collecting the keys for the Room.

3.3 It is agreed between the Landlord and the Tenant that the date on which this agreement shall come into being is the date
specified under the Landlord's signature below and references to "the date of this agreement" in this agreement shall be
construed accordingly.

**4** **Tenant's obligation to pay rent and other sums**

4.1 The Tenant must pay the Rent in advance in the amounts and on the dates set out in Clause 2. The first payment is due
before the Tenant accepts the keys for the Room.

4.2 Included in the Rent is an allowance towards utility costs of £250. The Landlord reserves the right to recharge to the Tenant
any additional costs incurred above this amount for utilities (water, electricity, gas). These costs will be monitored by the
accommodation team and notification of excess energy consumption as soon as practical.

4.3 Tenant is responsible for paying any local council tax, or other local tax, which becomes due during the dates of this
agreement. If required to do so by the local council, or the Landlord, the Tenant must obtain a council tax student
exemption notice and provide a copy of this to the management office at the Property. Though students are usually exempt
from council tax, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tenant agrees that he or she will be liable for any council tax, or other local
tax, liability that may arise for any period covered under the dates of this agreement.

4.4  If payment of Rent or any other amount under this agreement is paid late, the Tenant must pay interest at the rate of 1%
above the base lending rate of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc from time to time on the outstanding amount from the due
date until payment is received in full.

4.5 Rent is always due in advance; if you fail to pay your rent in advance then the accommodation team will begin the arrears
collection process. Failure to pay Rent will result in court action being taken; this will be at full cost to the Tenant and will be
added onto your outstanding balance.

**5** **Cancellation Policy and Distance Selling Regulations**

5.1 Unless the Residential Period has commenced, or you have already collected the keys to the accommodation, you may
cancel your booking by writing or sending an e-mail to us at tenants@collegiate-ac.com, at any time during the 14 days
after we send you an e-mail confirming your booking is complete. If you do that, we will make no charge and will return the
Reservation Fee to you.

5.2 In the event that you want to terminate this agreement prior to the end of the Residential Period, you will need to find
another tenant to replace you and take over your tenancy. Your tenancy period is for the Residential Period stated in Clause
2 of this agreement; whomever takes over the tenancy must take over the tenancy for the remaining period – A £50 admin
fee will apply to set up a replacement tenant.

**6** **Reservation Fee and Deposit**

6.1 The Tenant shall pay the Reservation Fee on or before the date of this agreement.

6.2 If for whatever reason the Landlord is not able to make an offer of accommodation to the Tenant, or to provide the Room to
the Tenant, the Reservation Fee will be returned in full to the Tenant. The Reservation Fee is otherwise non-refundable.

6.3 The Reservation Fee will be used as part payment of the Deposit at the commencement of the Residential Period. The
balance of the Deposit due will be collected with the first rental payment.

6.4 The Deposit will be managed by the Management Company in accordance with The Tenancy Deposit Schemes (Scotland)
Regulations 2011 ("the Deposit Regulations"), and will be paid into a tenancy deposit scheme within 30 days of the
commencement of the tenancy. The Management Company will provide the Tenant with access to a Deposit Protection
Certificate (DPC), in paper or electronic form, confirming the deposit has been registered and protected.

equipment provided (fair wear and tear excepted), or any excess utility charges incurred above the tenant’s allowance, or
any unpaid Rent or other unpaid charges, or other tenant liabilities including local taxes, incurred during the duration of
this agreement or for any loss arising as a result of breach by the Tenant of their obligations in terms of this agreement
(including the Landlord's and the Management Agents' proper and reasonable costs of enforcing or attempting to enforce
the Tenant's obligations and the costs of instructing advisers). Any such liabilities, costs, or charges will be deducted from
the Deposit by the Managing Agent for the benefit of The Landlord acting reasonably.

6.6 The balance of the Deposit shall be paid to the Tenant less any reasonable costs incurred for the breach of any obligation
under this agreement.

6.7 Any interest earned on the Deposit will belong to the Landlord.

6.8 As a tenant, your Deposit will be protected in terms of the Deposit Regulations. This will ensure that your Deposit is held in trust
and in the event that any disputes occur you will have clear rules and guidance on your rights and how disputes can be resolved.

**7** **Tenancy inspections and Deposit Release**

7.1 The Tenant will arrange a suitable time with the Management Company for an inspection of Flat, or Flat and Room. The
purpose of the inspection is to determine the condition of the Flat and, or, Room and whether any charges are to be made.
The Management Company will tell the Tenant within 10 working days of the end date on this agreement if they propose to
make any deductions from the Deposit.

7.2 If the Tenant signs the vacating inspection sheet by way of agreement as to the amount of the Deposit to be returned, the
Management Company will instruct for the Deposit to be returned within 10 working days of the date on which the vacating
inspection sheet was signed, or the end of the Residential Period, whichever is the later. If the Tenant vacates without
arranging an inspection, the Management Company will instruct for the return the Deposit, or part of the Deposit, if any,
within the timescales as set out in the Deposit Regulations.

7.3 If the Tenant disputes any deductions that have been made from the Deposit, these should be notified to the Management
Company within 20 working days of the notification of charges.

7.4 If, after 10 working days following the notification of a dispute to the Management Company, and reasonable attempts
having been made in that time to resolve any differences of opinion, there remains an unresolved dispute between the
Landlord and the Tenant over the allocation of the Deposit the dispute can be submitted will (subject to Clause 7.6 below)
be submitted for adjudication. All parties agree to co-operate with the adjudication.

7.5 The Tenant’s rights and process are further explained in the Deposit Protection Certificate (DPC) and accompanying
information which will be available to the Tenant after the commencement of the Residential Period once the Deposit has
been filed with the tenancy deposit scheme operated by MyDeposits Scotland: www.mydepositsscotland.co.uk

7.6 The statutory rights of the Landlord and the Tenant to take legal action through a court remain unaffected by this Clause 7.
