Whilst the use of alcohol is not illegal, the University recognises the harms that excessive alcohol use can

drink or feel comfortable around others’ drinking. Homebrewing and/or distilling of alcohol in residences is
not permitted.

Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, it is a criminal offence for the University knowingly to permit the
following in residences: producing a controlled drug; the supply or attempt to supply a controlled drug, or
offering to supply a controlled drug; the preparation of opium for smoking; or the smoking of cannabis,
cannabis resin or prepared opium on site.

The University supports a harm reduction approach. Students who are found in possession of drugs,
regardless of the drug classification, can expect to have these confiscated but will be offered support and
education. The University reserves the right to take disciplinary action where appropriate, as outlined
below.

    - First instance: a warning and a follow up meeting with the Residential Life service to discuss
support and any onward referral needed.

reduction session and signposted to further support.

    - Third instance: student referred to the University’s Police Officer for consideration of further
actions including being referred to the Police’s drug education programme (DEP).

A harm reduction stance does not mean anti-social or criminal behaviour due to drugs including alcohol is
acceptable, any such misconduct will continue to be addressed robustly through the Student Disciplinary
Regulations.

Drug use is not to be regarded as the same as being involved in the supply of illegal drugs. Any student
believed to be involved in the production or supply of illegal drugs will be referred to the University’s Police
Officer for consideration of criminal prosecution.

All residences are non-smoking. Students must not smoke or vape in any bedrooms or communal areas
