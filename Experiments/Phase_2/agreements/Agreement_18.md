# SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT

### FOR THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR

#### *********************************************** This version of the Agreement is in place from March 2022 onwards

 ***********************************************

**March 2022**


-----

**The private residential tenancy: know your rights**

Your tenancy agreement

- Your tenancy is open-ended, which means it doesn’t have a fixed length or a set date it

will end. Your landlord cannot include an expected end date or minimum period in your
tenancy agreement.

- If you are a joint tenant, all tenants are responsible for the rent, together and separately.

This will apply for as long as the tenancy continues.

- To end a joint tenancy, all the joint tenants must agree to end it and give the landlord

written notice that they want to leave. (You can transfer your interest in the tenancy to
someone else, if you have your landlord’s permission.)

Your deposit and rent

- Your landlord can only increase your rent once in a 12-month period, and must give you

at least three months’ notice that they are going to do this. If you think an increase is
**unreasonable, you can ask a rent officer from Rent Service Scotland to make a**
**decision on whether it is fair.**

- It is against the law for a landlord or letting agent to charge a fee or premium, or enter

into a loan arrangement with you, as a condition of granting, renewing or continuing your
tenancy. They can only charge you rent and a refundable deposit, and the deposit must
not be more than two months’ rent.

- If you have paid a landlord a deposit, they must pay it into an approved tenancy deposit

scheme, and give you further information about this within 30 working days of the start
of your tenancy. This information should include, for example, the amount paid and the
date it was paid, the address of the property, confirmation that the landlord is registered,
and contact details for the scheme.

- If your landlord has not paid your deposit into the scheme within this 30-day timescale,

you can take them to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property
Chamber), where they could be told to pay you up to three times the value of the
deposit.

Repairs

- You can apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber) if

your home doesn't reach a minimum standard of repair (known as the repairing
standard).

Ending a tenancy

- Your landlord cannot end your tenancy without good reason. They can only end it by

giving you ‘notice to leave’ for one or more of 18 reasons (grounds).

- If your landlord asks you to leave, they must give you:

`o` **28 days’ notice (if you have lived in the property for less than six months or the**

landlord is using one of the six ‘behaviour’ grounds); or
`o` **84 days’ notice (if you have lived in the property for more than six months and**

the landlord is not using the ‘behaviour’ grounds).

- If you want to leave, you must give your landlord 28 days’ notice in writing. In your

notice you will need to state the day you want the tenancy to end (this is normally the
day after the notice period has ended).

- If you disagree with the reason given in the notice to leave given to you by your landlord,

you do not need to leave your property until such times as your landlord has obtained an
eviction order from the First-tier Tribunal (Housing and Property Chamber).

- If you think that your tenancy was ended unlawfully (for example, the landlord served

you with a notice to leave on the grounds that they intended to sell the property, but then
they let it to another tenant), you can apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland
(Housing and Property Chamber). The Tribunal can award you up to six months' rent.

**SECTION 1: HOW TO USE THE MODEL**

A Landlord is under a duty to provide the written terms of a private residential tenancy
under section 10 of the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the Act”). This is
the Scottish Government’s Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement (“Model Tenancy
Agreement”) which may be used to fulfil this duty.

This Model Tenancy Agreement contains two categories of clause:

The first category is the core rights and obligations, which includes, among other things,
the statutory terms applicable to all private residential tenancies, the repairing standard and
tenancy deposits. They are ‘mandatory clauses’ which must feature in any agreement
prepared using this model. These terms are laid down in the Act, supporting secondary
legislation and other relevant housing legislation and are indicated in bold typeface. These
clauses should be read alongside the relevant legislation, as the legislation takes priority
and may change from time to time.

The second category is discretionary terms, which the Landlord may or may not wish to
include in the written tenancy agreement. These are in ordinary typeface. The Model
Tenancy Agreement contains a number of suggested terms which the Landlord may edit or
remove as required. This category will also include any additional terms the Landlord
chooses to add. Any additional terms added or edited by the Landlord must comply with
the requirements of the Act, supporting secondary legislation and other relevant legislation.

Some of the mandatory and discretionary clauses contain square brackets [    ], this
indicates clauses with options depending on the terms of the tenancy (such as frequency of
rent payments).


-----

Easy read notes on all of the clauses contained in this Model Tenancy Agreement are
provided in the Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential
Tenancy Agreement. If your Landlord has used this Model Private Residential Tenancy
Agreement they must also give you a copy of these Notes.

The Private Residential Tenancies (Information for Tenants) (Scotland) Regulations 2017
provide that if a Landlord chooses not to use this Model Private Residential Tenancy
Agreement, the Landlord is still legally required to give a Tenant a copy of the Private
Residential Tenancy Statutory Terms Supporting Notes.

A key to the different categories of clause has been included as a footnote for ease of
reference.

  - Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ): a defined area in which Scottish Ministers have put a

cap on how much rents for existing Tenants can be increased by each year. Any cap
set by Scottish Ministers will be at least consumer prices index (CPI) plus 1%, and

to children under 10. The rooms regarded as sleeping accommodation are defined
as being 'of a type normally used in the locality either as a bedroom or as a living
room'.

  - The space standard: sets limits on the number of people who can occupy a house,

relative to both the number and floor area of the rooms available as sleeping
accommodation. For this purpose, children aged at least one but less than 10 count
as half of a person, while children under the age of one do not count at all. Rooms of
less than 50 square feet are not taken into account.

Declaring for the purposes of this Agreement that words in the singular include the plural,
and where there are two or more persons included in the expression “the Tenant” the
obligations and conditions to be met by “the Tenant”, including payment of the rent, apply to
all such persons jointly and severally.

**and must obtain the Landlord’s written permission before carrying out any**
**trade, business or profession there.**

##### 7. RENT

**The first payment will be paid on 5 September 2022 and will be for the sum of**
**£1,282 in respect of the period 5 September 2022 to 30 September 2022. (The**
**maximum amount of rent which can be paid in advance is 6 months’ rent.)**

**Thereafter payments of £1,500 must be received on the 1st of the month and**
**then subsequently on or before the same date each calendar month thereafter.**

**Method by which rent is to be paid: Bank transfer**
**(This is the preferred method but rent may be paid using another method if it is**
**reasonable in the circumstances.)**

**The following services are included in the rent amount noted above:**

##### 8. RENT RECEIPTS

**Where any payment of rent is made in cash, the Landlord must provide the**
**Tenant with a dated written receipt for the payment stating: the amount paid,**
**and either (as the case may be) the amount which remains outstanding, or**
**confirmation that no further amount remains outstanding.**


-----

##### 9. RENT INCREASES

**The rent cannot be increased more than once in any twelve month period and**
**the Landlord must give the Tenant at least three months’ notice before any**
**increase can take place. In order to increase the rent, the Landlord must give**
**the Tenant a rent-increase notice, the content of which is set out in ‘The**
**Private Residential Tenancies (Prescribed Notices and Forms) (Scotland)**
**Regulations 2017’. The notice will be sent using the communication method**
**agreed in the ‘Communication’ clause above.**

**Within 21 days of receiving a rent-increase notice, the Tenant can refer the**
**increase to a rent officer for adjudication if he or she considers that the rent**
**increase amount is unreasonable, unless the property is located in a rent**
**pressure zone (RPZ). Before submitting a referral to a rent officer for rent**
**adjudication, the Tenant must complete Part 3 of the rent-increase notice and**
**return it to his or her Landlord to notify the Landlord of his or her intention to**
**make a referral to a rent officer. Failure to return Part 3 to the Landlord will**
**mean that the rent increase will take effect from the date proposed in the**
**notice.**

**If the Let property is located within a rent pressure zone, the Tenant cannot**
**refer a rent increase to a rent officer as Scottish Ministers will have set a cap**
**on the maximum amount the rent can be increased.**

##### 10. DEPOSIT

**The Landlord must lodge any deposit they receive with a tenancy deposit**
**scheme within 30 working days of the start date of the tenancy (when a**
**deposit is paid in instalments then each instalment must be lodged within 30**
**working days of that instalment being paid).**

**A tenancy deposit scheme is an independent third-party scheme approved by**
**the Scottish Ministers to hold and protect a deposit until it is due to be repaid.**

**At the start date of the tenancy or before, a deposit of £1,500 will be paid by**
**the Tenant to the Landlord. The Landlord will issue a receipt for the deposit to**
**the Tenant. No interest shall be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant for the**
**deposit.**

**By law, the deposit amount cannot exceed the equivalent of two months’ rent**
**and cannot include any premiums. For example, charging for an**
**administration fee or taking a holding fee (regardless of whether or not the**
**holding fee is refundable).**

The scheme administrator is Safedeposits Scotland and

**Where it is provided in this Agreement that the Tenant is responsible for a**
**particular cost or to do any particular thing and the Tenant fails to meet that**


-----

**cost, or the Landlord carries out work or performs any other obligation for**
**which the Tenant is responsible, the Landlord can apply for reasonable costs**
**to be deducted from any deposit paid by the Tenant.**

**This would include cases where a tenant has not paid all of the rent payable,**
**any amount in respect of one-off services, or unpaid utility bills, or a sum in**
**relation to breakages or cleaning.**

**At the end of the tenancy the Landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme**
**to release the deposit and the amounts payable to each party. If the Tenant**
**disagrees with the amount, the scheme administrator will provide a dispute**
**resolution mechanism.**

**Where the Tenant owes the Landlord an amount greater than the amount held**
**by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs,**
**and the Landlord may take action to recover the difference from the Tenant.**

**More information can be found in the Tenancy Deposit Schemes (Scotland)**
**[Regulations 2011. (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/176/contents/made)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/176/contents/made)**

##### 11. SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNATION

**Unless the Tenant has received prior written permission from the Landlord, the**
**Tenant must not:**

 - **sublet the Let Property (or any part of it),**

 - **take in a lodger,**

 - **assign the Tenant’s interest in the Let Property (or any part of it), or**

 - **otherwise part with, or give up to another person, possession of the Let**

**Property (or any part of it).**

##### 12. NOTIFICATION ABOUT OTHER RESIDENTS

**If a person aged 16 or over (who is not a Joint Tenant) occupies the Let**
**Property with the Tenant as that person’s only or principal home, the Tenant**
**must tell the Landlord in writing that person’s name, and relationship to the**
**Tenant.**

**If that person subsequently leaves the Let Property the Tenant must tell the**
**Landlord.**

**The Tenant will take reasonable care to ensure that anyone living with them**
**does not do anything that would be a breach of this Agreement if they were the**
**Tenant.** If they do, the Tenant will be treated as being responsible for any such
action and will be liable for the cost of any repairs, renewals or replacement of items
where required.

When allowing a person to occupy the Let Property with the Tenant as that person's
only or principal home, the Tenant must ensure that the Let Property does not
become an unlicensed "house in multiple occupation" (HMO) (see SECTION 2:
GLOSSARY OF TERMS for definition of "house in multiple occupation").


-----

The Tenant will be liable for reasonable costs and expenses, including if applicable,
legal or court expenses, payable by the Landlord or his or her Agent as a result of
the accommodation being, as a consequence of the Tenant's breach, deemed an
unlicensed or unregistered "house in multiple occupation".

##### 13. OVERCROWDING

**The number of people who may live in a Let Property depends on the number**
**and size of the rooms, and the age, gender and relationships of the people.**
**Living rooms and bedrooms are counted as rooms, but not the kitchen or**
**bathroom.**

**The Tenant must not allow the Let Property to become overcrowded. If the Let**
**Property does become overcrowded, the Landlord can take action to evict the**
**Tenant as the Tenant has breached this term of this Agreement.**

##### 14. INSURANCE

**The Landlord is responsible for paying premiums for any insurance of the**
**building and contents belonging to him or her, such as those items included in**
**the property inventory. The Landlord will have no liability to insure any items**
**belonging to the Tenant.**

**The Tenant is responsible for arranging any contents insurance which the**
**Tenant requires for his or her own belongings. The Tenant’s belongings may**
**include personal effects, foodstuffs and consumables, belongings, and any**
**other contents brought in to the Let Property by the Tenant.**

##### 15. ABSENCES

**The Tenant agrees to tell the Landlord if he or she is to be absent from the Let**
**Property for any reason for a period of more than 14 days. The Tenant must**
**take such measures as the Landlord may reasonably require to secure the Let**
**Property prior to such absence and take appropriate reasonable measures to**
**meet the ‘Reasonable Care’ section below.**

##### 16. REASONABLE CARE

**The Tenant agrees to take reasonable care of the Let Property and any**
**common parts, and in particular agrees to take all reasonable steps to:**

 - **keep the Let Property adequately ventilated and heated;**

 - **not bring any hazardous or combustible goods or material into the Let**

**Property, notwithstanding the normal and safe storage of petroleum and**
**gas for garden appliances (mowers etc.), barbecues or other commonly**
**used household goods or appliances;**

 - **not put any damaging oil, grease or other harmful or corrosive**

**substance into the washing or sanitary appliances or drains;**

 - **prevent water pipes freezing in cold weather;**


-----

**fire or flooding;**

 - **ensure the Let Property and its fixtures and fittings are kept clean**

**during the tenancy;**

 - **not interfere with the smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, heat**

**detectors or the fire alarm system;**

 - **not interfere with door closer mechanisms.**

##### 17. THE REPAIRING STANDARD etc. AND OTHER INFORMATION

**THE REPAIRING STANDARD**

**The Landlord is responsible for ensuring that the Let Property meets the**
**Repairing Standard.**

**The Landlord must carry out a pre-tenancy check of the Let Property to**
**identify work required to meet the Repairing Standard (described below) and**
**notify the Tenant of any such work. The Landlord also has a duty to repair and**
**maintain the Let Property from the start date of the tenancy and throughout**
**the tenancy. This includes a duty to make good any damage caused by doing**
**this work. On becoming aware of a defect, the Landlord must complete the**
**work within a reasonable time.**

**A privately rented Let Property must meet the Repairing Standard as follows:**

 - **The Let Property must be wind and water tight and in all other respects**

**reasonably fit for people to live in.**

 - **The structure and exterior (including drains, gutters and external pipes)**

**must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.**

 - **Installations for supplying water, gas and electricity and for sanitation,**

**space heating and heating water must be in a reasonable state of repair**
**and in proper working order.**

 - **Any fixtures, fittings and appliances that the Landlord provides under**

**the tenancy must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper**
**working order.**

 - **Any furnishings that the Landlord provides under the tenancy must be**

**capable of being used safely for the purpose for which they are**
**designed.**

 - **The Let Property must have a satisfactory way of detecting fires and for**

**giving warning in the event of a fire or suspected fire[1].**

 - **The Let Property must have a satisfactory way of giving warning if there**

**is a hazardous concentration of carbon monoxide gas[2].**

**More detail on the Repairing Standard is available in the Easy Read Notes for**
**the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement, or on**
**the Scottish Government website. If the Tenant believes that the Landlord has**
**failed to ensure that the Let Property meets the Repairing Standard at all times**
**during the tenancy, he or she should discuss this with the Landlord in the first**

-----

**instance. If the Landlord does not rectify the problem within a reasonable time,**
**the Tenant has the right to apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing**
**and Property Chamber (“the Tribunal”). The Tribunal may reject the**
**application; consider whether the case can be resolved by the Tenant and**
**Landlord (for example, by agreeing to mediation); consider the application; or**
**reject the case. The Tribunal has power to require a Landlord to carry out work**
**necessary to meet the Repairing Standard.**

**The Repairing Standard does not cover work for which the Tenant is**
**responsible due to his or her duty to use the Let Property in a proper manner;**
**nor does it cover the repair or maintenance of anything that the Tenant is**
**entitled to remove from the Let Property.**

**Structure & exterior:**

**The Landlord is responsible (together with any other owners of common parts**
**of the building in which the accommodation is situated, if appropriate) for**
**keeping in repair the structure and exterior of the accommodation.**

**Gas safety:**

**The Landlord must ensure that there is an annual Gas safety check on all**
**pipework and appliances carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. The**
**Tenant must be given a copy of the Landlord’s gas safety certificate. The**
**Landlord must keep certificates for at least 2 years. The Gas Safety**
**(Installation and use) Regulations 1998 places duties on Tenants to report any**
**defects with gas pipework or gas appliances that they are aware of to the**
**Landlord. Tenants are forbidden to use appliances that have been deemed**
**unsafe by a gas contractor.**

**The Landlord must also ensure that a carbon monoxide detector is installed**
**where there is a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance (excluding an appliance used**
**solely for cooking) or where a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance is situated in an**
**inter-connected space such as a garage. A carbon monoxide detector is also**
**required in the bedrooms and main living room if a flue from a carbon-fuelled**
**appliance passes through the room. “Carbon-fuelled” includes wood, coal and**
**oil as well as gas.**

**Electrical safety:**

**The Landlord must ensure that an electrical safety inspection is carried out at**
**least every five years consisting of an Electrical Installation Condition Report**
**(EICR) and Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) on appliances provided by the**

## Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement

**EASY READ NOTES FOR THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MODEL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL**

**TENANCY AGREEMENT**

**INTRODUCTION**

These Notes can help you understand your tenancy agreement if you have a private
residential tenancy. They will also help you to know about your rights, and about the
things you should be doing or not doing during your tenancy. These Notes also
explain what to do if your landlord interferes with your rights, or if there is a problem
between you and your landlord about your tenancy.

It’s the law that your landlord must give you all the written terms of your tenancy. The
Scottish Government has produced a model tenancy agreement, which landlords
can use to do this. It is called the ‘Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement’.
Your Landlord has used this model agreement so they must also give you a copy of
these Notes.

These Notes explain all of the different parts of your tenancy agreement. Each part
of your agreement is numbered, and you will be able to look for the same numbers in
these Notes to find information about each part.

The things in bold on your tenancy agreement are things that laws say that you or
your landlord must do, or must not do. The laws which say these things are listed at
the end of these Notes. These Notes will help you understand these parts.

If what’s written isn’t in bold, your landlord did not have to include these tenancy
terms in your agreement. The Scottish Government has given your landlord
suggested wording for these terms, which your landlord can use if they want to. If
your landlord has used the suggested text, these Notes will help you to understand
that term. If your landlord has used their own wording for a term, or chosen not to
include it at all, these Notes will not give information about that term. If you need
more information about any terms which are not in these Notes, you may want to
discuss them with your landlord, or contact the advice groups listed at the end of
these Notes.

If you have a new tenancy, your landlord must give you all your tenancy terms in
writing and a copy of these Notes before the end of the day on which the tenancy
starts.

If you have a different type of tenancy which is changing into a private residential
tenancy, your landlord has 28 days after the day when the tenancy becomes a
private residential tenancy to give you your new tenancy terms and a copy of these
Notes.


-----

If your landlord does not give you all the written terms of your tenancy and/or these
Notes when they are supposed to, you can apply to the First-tier Tribunal for
Scotland Housing and Property Chamber ("the Tribunal"). The Tribunal may then
give you a written tenancy and/or order your landlord to pay you up to six months'
rent.

You must give your landlord 28 days’ notice if you are going to apply to the Tribunal
for this reason, and you must apply using the 'Tenant's notification to a landlord of a
referral to the First-tier Tribunal for failure to supply in writing all tenancy terms
and/or any other specified information'. There are guidance notes available to help
you to fill in this form if needed.

**In these Easy Read Notes:**

The word "Agreement" means the tenancy agreement for the property which

is being leased; and

The "Tribunal" is the First-Tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property

Chamber, which deals with disputes for tenancies of homes. The
process should be easy and there is no cost to apply to the tribunal. You
can access the form here:

[https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal](https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal)

The Form has guidance notes to help. You can also get help from the
advice groups listed at the end of these Notes.

The landlord might appoint an agent to manage the Agreement and if they

do, then when these Notes refer to the landlord, in practice that might
instead be a reference to the landlord's agent who will be acting on
behalf of the landlord.

**Tenant**

If there is more than one person named on the Agreement as the Tenant the
tenancy will be a joint tenancy. This means that each person is responsible
on their own individually - as well as equally along with all of the others - for all
of the payments and other things the tenant is required to do under the
tenancy. For example, if any of the tenants in a joint tenancy fell into rent
arrears, the landlord could ask one of the other named tenants to pay the
money owed.

That person must pay the landlord the full sum that is owed and then try to get
the other people who are also joint tenants to repay them their share.

The addresses the tenant(s) provides will usually be their current addresses
and not the property that is being rented and that they are going to move into
under the Agreement.

The Agreement could include details of tenant email addresses and telephone
numbers.

If the Landlord and Tenant agree that formal written notices will be given by

email instead of by letter (see Note 4 – Communication), then email
addresses must be provided.  If the Agreement does not allow notices


-----

to be given by email then it is not essential for email addresses to be
given.

The Agreement does not say that any formal notice or other communication

can be done by telephone, so it is not essential for telephone numbers to
be given. But it might be useful to have telephone numbers available in
an emergency or to speed up communications between the landlord and
tenant.

**Landlord**

The names and addresses of the landlord(s) should be shown on your
Agreement.

Landlord email addresses and telephone numbers might also be given.

If the Landlord and Tenant agree that formal written notices will be given by

email instead of by letter (see Note 4 – Communication) then email
addresses must be shown here. If the Agreement does not allow notices
to be given by email then email addresses don’t need to be given.

The Agreement does not say that any formal notice or other type of contact

can be made by phone, so phone numbers don’t need to be given.
However, it might be useful to have phone numbers in an emergency or
to speed up contact between the landlord and tenant.

The registration number of the landlord should be given. This is the landlord's
number under the landlord registration scheme run by local councils. The idea
of this scheme is to make sure that a private landlord is a "fit and proper
person" before that landlord can rent out property. Landlords must register
and tenants can check if their landlord has registered by looking them up at
[https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/)

**Communication**

You can sign this agreement "electronically" by typing your name - instead of
signing a paper copy. It will still be a legal document that the landlord and
tenant must comply with by law.

The Agreement should say whether notices and letters must be sent in paper
letter form only or whether emails will be used instead.

The tenant does not need to agree to receive notices under the Agreement by
email. If the tenant agrees to receive notices by email this could include
important messages. For example telling the tenant that the rent is to go up
or that the Tenancy is being brought to an end. You should think about
whether email would be the right way to receive important information. The
landlord and the tenant must tell each other about changes to their email
addresses.

If you don’t inform your landlord about a change of email address you might
miss an important email such as a Notice to Leave. That would mean that the
Notice to Leave sent to the old email address would still be accepted by the
Tribunal as having been properly sent even though the notice was not actually
received by the tenant. In this case you can still be evicted. In the event that
the email correspondence method is unavailable or unusable by either party,


-----

the Tribunal may take a view that recorded delivery would be acceptable. This
is at the discretion of the Tribunal.

When the notice is sent by email or recorded delivery post, then an extra 2
days should be added to the notice period to allow time for delivery. This is
required by law, even if it is not stated in the tenancy agreement. This applies
both when a tenant is sending a notice to their landlord, or when a landlord is
sending a notice to their tenant.

For example, if one months' notice needs to be given before 31 December
2017, then if the notice is being given by post or by email, it should be posted
or emailed no later than 28 November 2017. If the notice is being delivered by
hand (this would normally involve a Sheriff Officer if a landlord was giving a
notice of removal - Paragraph 34.8 of the Act Of Sederunt (Sheriff Court
Ordinary Cause Rules) 1993 No.1956 (S.223) refers), it should be delivered
no later than 30 November 2017.

**Details of the property**

The Agreement will contain the address and other details about the property for example whether the property is a flat or a bungalow.

The Agreement should make it clear:

what areas and facilities are included in the property and if any of those are to

be shared; and

what (if any) areas are not included.

This information is helpful if the property is part of a larger building where it
might not be obvious which parts of the larger building are included in the
property being let.

The Agreement may list shared areas, such as a shared garden or communal
entrance area.

The Agreement may list parts not included in the property being let, such as,
for example, a part of the garden or a parking space which is only to be used
by another tenant of the building.

The Agreement should say whether or not the property is to have any furniture
provided by the landlord. If there is furniture, it will probably be listed in an
Inventory and Record of Condition. This is a list of all the items included so
that the landlord and tenant can agree what was there at the start of the
Agreement, and the condition of these things at the start of the Agreement.

The Agreement should say whether the property is in a Rent Pressure Zone. If
it is, then the landlord will only be allowed to increase the rent by a certain
amount each year. More information on this can be found on the Scottish
[Government’s website: https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/)
[tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/)

The Agreement should say whether the property is a House in Multiple
Occupation (HMO). A home is an HMO:

   - if it is occupied by three or more adults (aged 16 or over)


-----

   - they are from three or more families

   - the home is their only or main residence

   - it is either a house, premises or a group of premises owned by the same
person with shared basic amenities (a toilet, personal washing facilities,
and facilities for the preparation or provision of cooked food) (as defined
in section 125 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006)

If the property is an HMO, the Agreement should give the 24 hour contact
number and the date on which the licence for the HMO will finish.

HMO landlords must have a licence from the local authority to make sure that
the property is managed properly and meets legal safety standards. Because
the landlord needs to get a licence if the property is an HMO, it is important
that the tenant tells the landlord if extra people move into the property (see
Note 13 – Notification about other Residents).

**Start date of the Tenancy**

The Agreement must state the date when the tenancy begins, which will be
when the tenant can move into the property.

**Occupation & Use of the property**

The tenant is to live at the property as the tenant's home.

The tenant must get the landlord's written consent, in advance, if the tenant
wants to use the property for any work or business, in addition to living in the
property.

There are many reasons why a landlord might not agree to allow any work or
business use of the property, including for example:

the deeds which set out the landlord's ownership of the property do not allow

that use; or

the planning permission (from the local council) for use of the property does

not allow work or business use; or

the landlord thinks that the actual work or business which the tenant wants to

do at the property would be likely to disturb or annoy neighbours; or

use of the property for any work or business might make the landlord's

insurance for the property more expensive or even invalid; or

the terms of the landlord’s mortgage policy do not allow the property to be

used for work or business.

**Rent**

The Agreement should specify the amount of rent, and how often that amount
is to be paid. The payment times might be weekly, every 2 weeks, every 4
weeks, monthly, 4 times a year or once every 6 months.

The rent payments could be due to be paid in advance (at the beginning of
each such amount of time) or in arrears (after that amount of time has


-----

passed). The maximum amount of rent which a landlord can ask their tenant
to pay in advance is 6 months’ rent.

The Agreement should say:

the date on which the first payment is to be made and how long that amount

of money will cover; and

on which date rent will next need to be paid.

The Agreement lets the landlord say how the rent should be paid. For
example, the landlord might want the rent payments to be paid by bank
transfer or by cheque. It is possible for the tenant to pay using another way, if
that is fair. For instance, it might not be considered fair to pay the rent by a
method which would result in a high bank charge to the landlord, such as
payments made using some credit cards.

The Agreement should also state if any services are to be included in the rent.
This is to make it clear that the tenant would not have to pay extra for those
services. For example, the rent might include the cost of lighting a shared hall
or stair cleaning costs. Any services which are paid monthly should be
included as part of the rent. For example, if a landlord pays for stair and
window cleaning and charges the tenant monthly for this cleaning that would
be included. The services which are included in the rent should be listed in the
Agreement along with the amount for each service.

Where there are one-off payments throughout a tenancy, such as where the
landlord agrees to carry out a repair for the tenant for a fee, then this will not
form part of the rent.

The landlord is not allowed to charge a tenant for other services - such as the
cost of preparing a lease, 'key money', administration charges, or for the cost
of preparing an inventory etc. These charges are known as 'premiums'. If the
landlord charges a premium, the tenant should write and ask for a refund. If
the landlord refuses to provide a refund, then a claim could be made through
the Tribunal. The tenant could also contact the local council’s landlord
registration team, or, if the landlord holds a HMO licence, the tenant could
contact the local council’s licensing team to help with this.

Rents of tenants with a private residential tenancy in a rent pressure zone can
only rise, each year, by an amount set by Scottish Ministers which is linked to
inflation (rises in the cost of living generally). More detailed information on this
is available at **_[https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/)_**
**_[tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-tenants-guide/pages/rent-and-other-charges/)_**

A landlord in a Rent Pressure Zone can also apply to the Rent Officer to allow
a further increase to your rent because the landlord has done work to improve
the property. This increase in rent would be in addition to any inflation related
increase in the rent.

**Rent Receipts**

If the tenant pays rent in cash then the landlord must give the tenant a written
receipt.

That receipt must show:


-----

the amount paid,

the date on which that amount was paid; and

whether the rent is now paid up to date - and, if it is not, how much is still to be

paid.

**Rent Increases**

The rent can only go up once a year. Before the rent can go up, the tenant
must be given an official notice called a rent-increase notice. This notice might
be sent by email if the Agreement allows for this. Any rent-increase notice
must be given to the tenant by the landlord at least 3 months before the date
that the rent is to go up.

If the tenant receives a rent-increase notice, and the tenant thinks that the
new rent would be higher than is being charged at that time for similar
properties, then the tenant can ask a Rent Officer to decide whether the
increase is fair.

"Fair" here means an amount similar to the rent which is, at that time, being
charged for similar properties on new lettings. It does not mean how much the
tenant can afford to pay.

Tenants must follow certain steps to ask the Rent Officer to make this
decision and there is a 21 day time limit for this to be done. If these steps are
not followed by the tenant within the 21 day time limit then the tenant will lose
their right to challenge the rent increase - and the rent will be increased to the
amount wanted by the landlord.

These steps are as follows:

The tenant must return Part 3 of the rent-increase notice to the landlord - to

tell the landlord that the tenant intends to ask the Rent Officer to decide
whether the rent increase is fair;

The tenant then fills in a form called the Tenant's Rent Increase Referral to a

Rent Officer under section 24 (1) of the Private Housing (Tenancies)
(Scotland) Act 2016 to be used for this purpose, a copy of which can be
accessed on the Scottish Government website, or through Rent Service
Scotland – see Useful Contacts and Links at the end of these Notes; and

The tenant then sends the finished form to the Rent Officer.

All of this must be done within 21 days after the tenant receives the rentincrease notice. If this is not done then the rent increase will go ahead.

If the tenant accepts the rent increase, they should return Part 3 of rentincrease notice to the landlord to tell them that.

Part 3 of the rent-increase notice can also be returned to the landlord by the
tenant to say if the tenant has not been given long enough notice of a rent
increase - so if less than 3 months’ notice was given. If the landlord gives less
than the 3 months' notice, then the tenant will not need to pay the increased
rent until 3 months have passed. So the landlord cannot try and increase the
rent on one month's notice for example.


-----

If the property is in a Rent Pressure Zone, the tenant cannot go to a Rent
Officer about the rent increase. That is because the Scottish Ministers have
already limited the amount by which the rent can be increased. (See Note 8 –
Rent). As the landlord cannot increase the rent higher than the cap, the tenant
doesn’t need to pay any rent above the cap. The tenant has a number of
options:
only pay the rent up to the limit of the cap as the tenant is at no risk of

eviction;
contact one of the advice groups listed at the end of these Notes; or
apply to the Tribunal to draw up the terms of the tenancy (as the terms of

tenancy have changed as the rent has increased).

You should tell your landlord what you intend to do. In any event, if you apply
to the Tribunal, your landlord must be given 28 days’ notice.

**Deposit**

When a tenant moves into a rented home, most landlords will ask for a
deposit. This is a sum of money which acts as a guarantee against various
things, such as damage that the tenant may do to the property, costs for any
cleaning which may be needed, bills (for example electricity) that are left
unpaid, as well as any unpaid rent.

The total amount of the deposit cannot be more than 2 months' rent. If the
tenant is charged more than two months' rent, then the tenant can contact
Shelter Scotland or a Citizens Advice Bureau for advice about claiming back
the extra amount. It is an offence to require payment of any premium (in
addition to the rent and a refundable deposit of no more than two months’
rent) as a condition of the grant, renewal or continuance of a tenancy.

A deposit must be held by a tenancy deposit scheme until the end of the
tenancy. This is to stop the landlord using a deposit as if it was their own
money. Tenancy deposit schemes are run by independent companies which
are approved by the Scottish Government. The landlord has to pay the
deposit to one of the schemes within 30 working days from the start of the
tenancy (working days are usually Monday to Friday - so 30 working days is
usually 6 weeks). When a deposit is paid in instalments then each instalment
must be lodged within 30 working days of that instalment being paid. There
will be no charge to the tenant or landlord to pay the deposit into one of the
schemes.

It is good practice for a landlord or letting agent to pay a deposit, or part
deposit (when joint tenants pay their share of a deposit), to one of the
approved tenancy deposit schemes as soon as possible after the start of the
tenancy. This is very important as a landlord or letting agent has no authority
to retain any deposit/part deposit at any time.

A landlord or letting agent is not permitted to charge any premiums. By paying
any deposit received into a scheme promptly, a landlord/letting agent is clearly
demonstrating that any deposit received is always being treated as a deposit
and not as a premium.

Any retention of a deposit by a landlord or letting agent is a serious matter, as
deductions from tenancy deposits can only be done by one of the approved


-----

tenancy deposit schemes in accordance with the Tenancy Deposit
Regulations. The First Tier Tribunal (Housing and Property Chamber) will not
look favourably at cases where the landlord or letting agent has deviated from
paying the money into a tenancy deposit scheme. When a tenant has signed
a tenancy and changes their mind a day or two before the tenancy is due to
start, the deposit should be returned as any deduction from it would be
equivalent to charging a premium.

Sometimes a landlord or letting agent will insert a discretionary (their own)
clause in the private residential tenancy agreement to make clear about any
reimbursement of expenses they will require if a tenant that has committed to
a tenancy decides not to take up the tenancy shortly before it starts. Such
reimbursement should not be deducted from the deposit. It is essential that a
landlord or letting agent makes this clear from the outset in writing. A tenant
should never be in any doubt about what they are signing up to and what
obligations a landlord or letting agent has placed on them.

What happens when a deposit is lodged?

The tenant should receive a letter or email from the tenancy deposit scheme
confirming that their deposit has been lodged. The letter will set out the
amount of the deposit and explain how it will be repaid and how any disputes
can be settled.

If the tenant does not receive a letter from an approved deposit scheme after
6 weeks, they should contact their landlord. If the landlord has not lodged their
deposit, the tenant should raise a complaint with the Tribunal. If the landlord
has not used one of the schemes, the Tribunal can order the landlord to pay
up to 3 times the deposit to the tenant.

Within 30 working days after the start of the tenancy the landlord must give
the tenant all of this information about the deposit:

- the amount of the deposit;

- the date that the landlord received the deposit and the date that the
landlord paid the deposit into a scheme;

- the address of the property to which the deposit relates - so the property
let to the tenant;

- a statement from the landlord confirming the landlord is registered or has
applied to be registered with the local council;

- the name and contact details of the tenancy deposit scheme where the
deposit was paid;

- and the terms on which the deposit is held - including (1) when the
deposit is to be returned to the tenant and (2) the circumstances where
the landlord can be paid some or all of the deposit at the end of the
tenancy, instead of the deposit being paid back to the tenant.

Examples of money that the landlord can ask to be paid by the scheme (and
not paid back to the tenant) are:


-----

   - unpaid rent

   - other amounts not paid or the cost of any repairs needed if the tenant
caused the damage

   - to pay bills left unpaid by the tenant

If there are no issues like that at the end of the tenancy, then the
landlord should ask the scheme to pay the full amount of the deposit
back to the tenant.

At the end of the tenancy the landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme
to release the deposit and the amounts payable to the tenant and the
Landlord.

The deposit scheme will contact the tenant to check whether the tenant
agrees with the landlord's figures.

Different things happen, depending on whether the tenant agrees with the
landlord's figures or not:

   - If the tenant agrees with the landlord's figures, then the scheme will pay
those amounts to the landlord and tenant.

   - If the tenant does not agree with the landlord's figures, then the tenant
must contact the landlord. The landlord and the tenant need to try to
agree what, if any, amount is to be deducted from the deposit and kept
by the landlord. If the landlord and tenant cannot agree, the tenant can
ask the Tenancy Deposit Scheme which holds their deposit to use their
dispute resolution process. The dispute will be sent to an independent
adjudicator who has the role of reaching a decision in a dispute. The
adjudicator will be given any evidence (for example photographs or
receipts) and will come to a decision about the amount (if any) to be
given by the scheme to the landlord and the amount to be repaid to the
tenant.

If the tenant does not respond within 30 days, then the landlord will be paid
the amount that the landlord requested be deducted for rent, repairs and other
costs - and the rest (if anything is left) will be repaid to the tenant. If the
landlord has not, by the time that the tenancy ends, asked the scheme to
release the deposit, then the tenant can apply to the deposit scheme for
repayment. In that case, the deposit scheme will contact the landlord to ask
whether the landlord agrees that the whole deposit should be repaid to the
tenant or whether the landlord thinks that an amount should be taken off and
paid to the landlord.

If the landlord does not agree that the whole deposit should be repaid to the
tenant, then the landlord can try to agree the figures with the tenant. But if the
landlord and tenant cannot agree the figures, then the decision is referred to
an independent decision-maker.

**Sub-letting & Assignation**

The Agreement will probably only give the landlord's permission for the
tenant(s) that are named in the Agreement to live in or use the property.


-----

The tenant is not allowed to:

enter into another agreement to sublet the property (or part of it) to another

person, or

take in a lodger, or

enter into an agreement to try to transfer the tenancy (or part of it) to

somebody else, or

allow another person to start living in the property (or part of it) or using it for

some other purpose.

As a general rule, if the tenant wants to allow anyone else to live in or use the
property as their only or main home, then the tenant must get the landlord's
written permission. The landlord does not have to give that permission.

**Notification about other Residents**

If a person who is over 16 lives at the property with the tenant as their only or
main home, then the tenant has to write to the landlord (or email the landlord if
email is the agreed method of contact). The tenant's letter (or email) must tell
the landlord the name of the person who has started to live at the property
with the tenant and the tenant's relationship with that person. Then, if that
person leaves the property, the tenant must also tell the landlord that this has
happened. For example, if a couple take a joint tenancy and live with their two
children aged 14 and 15, when each of those children become 16, the
Landlord should be notified. Also, where a husband takes a single tenancy but
lives with his wife, he should notify the landlord that his wife lives with him.

If a tenant dies while they are the only tenant under a private residential
tenancy, a partner, family member or carer can inherit their tenancy under
certain conditions, as long as the tenant did not inherit the tenancy from
someone else in the first place.

In order for a person to inherit the tenancy, they must:

   - have been living in the property as their only or main home at the time of
the tenant’s death, and

   - the tenant must have already notified the landlord.

There are several types of relationship with the tenant which might allow
someone to inherit the tenancy:

1. If the person was married or in a civil partnership with the tenant at the

time of the tenant’s death, the person will inherit the tenancy, as long
as:

     - they have been living in the property as their only or main home at
the time of the tenant’s death, and

     - the tenant must have already notified the landlord.

2. If the person was a partner of the tenant (but was not married to them

or in a civil partnership with them) to be allowed to inherit the tenancy:


-----

     - they must have been living in the property as their only or main
home for at least 12 months without any breaks up to the
tenant’s death, and

     - the tenant must have already notified the landlord

The 12 months will be counted from the time when the tenant told the
landlord that the person was living in the property. Any time when the
person was living in the property before the landlord was told will not
count.

3. If the tenant does not have a partner to inherit their tenancy, any

**qualifying family members who are at least 16 years of age when the**
tenant dies can inherit the tenancy, if:

     - they have been living in the property as their only or main home for
**at least 12 months without any breaks up to the tenant’s death,**
and

     - the tenant must have already notified the landlord

The 12 months will be counted from the time when the tenant told the
landlord that the person was living in the property. Any time when the
person was living in the property before the landlord was told will not
count.

The tenant has to take care that no one living with the tenant at the property
does anything that would break the rules of the Agreement. If any person
living with the tenant at the property breaks the rules of the Agreement, then
the tenant will be responsible for that (as if the tenant was the person who had
broken the rule) and, for example, would have to pay for anything broken by
that person.

If the property is not a House in Multiple Occupation or HMO (see Note 5 –
Details of the property) at the start of the Agreement, then the tenant has to
make sure that, by letting other people (who are not part of the tenant's family)
move in and use the property as their only or main home, the property does
not become an HMO.

The tenant would have to pay the landlord back for any fines or other money
that the landlord ends up paying because the property has become an HMO.
This would include any fines or penalties payable by the landlord because the
property is being used as an HMO without being registered as one.

**Overcrowding**

The tenant must not allow the property to become overcrowded. If the tenant
does allow this to happen, then the landlord can evict the tenant.

What counts as overcrowding for a property depends on the number and size
of the rooms, as well as the age, gender (male or female) and relationships of
the people that live there.

There is a room standard and a space standard when working out if there is
overcrowding. The Scottish Government's Guidance to local authorities gives
details of the standards at Annex A. This guidance can be accessed here:


-----

[https://www.gov.scot/publications/licensing multiple occupied housing](https://www.gov.scot/publications/licensing-multiple-occupied-housing-statutory-guidance-for-scottish-local-authorities/)
[statutory-guidance-for-scottish-local-authorities/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/licensing-multiple-occupied-housing-statutory-guidance-for-scottish-local-authorities/)

If too many people do live at a property, the local authority might do
something to stop the overcrowding.

A home is an HMO:

   - if it is occupied by three or more adults (aged 16 or over)

   - they are from three or more families

   - the home is their only or main residence

   - it is either a house, premises or a group of premises owned by the same
person with shared basic amenities (a toilet, personal washing facilities,
and facilities for the preparation or provision of cooked food) (as defined
in section 125 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006)

The local authority will tell the landlord how many people are allowed to live in
any HMO property.

More advice on overcrowding is available from Shelter Scotland or the
council.

**Insurance**

The landlord will pay the premiums if they insure the property and any items
which belong to the landlord, for example any furniture on the inventory.

The tenant can choose whether or not to insure the things that the tenant
brings into the property. Insuring the tenant's belongings is not the
responsibility of the landlord.

The tenant must pay for the cost of any damage caused by the tenant (or by
any visitors) to the property or fixtures and fittings, for example kitchen
cupboards, fitted wardrobes and fitted kitchen appliances.

Any defect or breakdown caused by normal wear and tear does not need to
be paid for by the tenant. Wear and tear is allowed, because if you use
something in the normal way, then it will become worn out over time. The
tenant should not have to pay to replace things which have just been worn out
by being used in a normal way.

**Absences**

A long absence from the property may affect the landlord’s insurance costs. If
the tenant is not going to be at the property for more than 2 weeks at a time,
then the tenant must do three things:

Before the property is left unoccupied, the tenant must tell the landlord that

they won’t be there and for how long;

Before leaving, the tenant must do anything reasonable that the landlord has

asked the tenant to do to keep the property secure during the tenant's


-----

absence this means to stop the property being broken into or lived in by
anyone else; and

Before leaving, the tenant must have checked the property to be sure that,

during the tenant's absence, reasonable care will still be taken of the
property, as set out in Note 17 – Reasonable Care. For example, if the
property is going to be empty during the winter time the tenant should
make sure that (1) the heating is on timer, to stop the property getting
damp inside and (2) the water is turned off, to prevent damage that
might be caused by burst pipes.

**Reasonable Care**

The tenant must take reasonable care of the property and of any common
areas that the tenant is allowed to use.

"Reasonable care" is the sort of care that a reasonable occupier would take to
keep the property in good condition, to keep safety systems in working order
and to limit the risk of any harm being done to other properties or to
neighbours.

Such "reasonable care" under the Agreement includes, for example, the
tenant taking all reasonable steps to:

keep the property adequately ventilated (aired out) and heated;

not bring any hazardous (dangerous) or combustible (easily catch fire) goods

or material into the property. The tenant can keep petrol and gas for
garden appliances (mowers etc.), barbecues or other commonly used
household goods or appliances in the property (or garden shed)
provided that these things are safely stored in appropriate containers;

not put any oil, grease or other harmful or corrosive substance into any toilet,

sink, bath, shower, washing machine, dishwasher or drain;

prevent water pipes freezing in cold weather - by not removing any lagging

and by keeping the property appropriately heated;

avoid danger to the property or neighbouring properties by way of fire or

flooding - for example, not leaving lit candles unattended or overloading
electricity sockets with too many plugs or leaving taps running;

keep the property and its fitted items clean;

not to do anything to stop the smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors,

heat detectors or the fire alarm system from working as they should; and

not to remove or prevent the working of or do anything else to door closer

mechanisms.

**The Repairing Standard Etc & Other Information**

1.1 The Repairing Standard

The landlord must ensure that the property is in the condition, and has
the facilities, set out in the Repairing Standard.


-----

If the property is not in that condition, or does not have any of those
facilities, the tenant or the local council can apply to the Tribunal to tell
the landlord to do what is needed.

The Repairing Standard means:

The property must be wind and water tight and in all other respects
fit for people to live in. For example, there should not be any gaps
between window or door frames and walls or any missing roof
slates or tiles, which result in wind or rain getting into the property.

The structure and exterior (including drains, gutters and external
pipes) must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper
working order. For example, walls must be in a reasonable
condition, as must roofs so as to avoid water leaking through the
roof into the property.

Installations for water supply, gas and electricity and for sanitation,
heating and heating water must be in a reasonable state of repair
and in proper working order.

Pipes, tanks, boilers, meters and cables, toilets, radiators and
other heaters - must all be in a reasonable state of repair and in
proper working order.

Any fixtures, fittings and appliances that the landlord provides
under the tenancy must be in a reasonable state of repair and in
proper working order. Appliances include, for example, kitchen and
laundry equipment such as cookers, microwave ovens, fridges and
freezers, washing machines, tumble dryers, kettles, toasters and
the like.

Any furnishings (such as chairs, settees and beds) that the
landlord provides under the tenancy must be capable of being
used safely for the purpose for which they are designed. One
thing that this will mean is that they meet fire retardant standards
(see Note 18.8 – Furnishings).

The property must have a way (such as smoke alarms wired to the
mains electricity supply or tamper proof long-life lithium battery
alarms) of detecting fires and for giving warning in the event of a
fire or suspected fire. (The Scottish Government guidance on this
is found at [https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-private-rented-properties/)
[private-rented-properties/)](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-private-rented-properties/)

The property must have a way to warn if carbon monoxide is
present in a concentration that is dangerous for people. (The
Scottish Government guidance on this is found at
[https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-monoxide-alarms-in-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-monoxide-alarms-in-private-rented-properties-guidance/)
[private-rented-properties-guidance/)](https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-monoxide-alarms-in-private-rented-properties-guidance/)

Before the tenancy begins, the landlord must check whether the
property meets the Repairing Standard. If it does not, the landlord
must notify the tenant of any work that needs to be done to make the
property meet the Repairing Standard - and the landlord must then
get that work done (at the landlord's cost) within a reasonable time.


-----

The landlord must also make sure the property meets the Repairing
Standard throughout the tenancy - except that the landlord does not
have to repair any damage that was caused by the tenant (which goes
beyond normal wear and tear).

If the tenant tells the landlord about a defect, then the landlord must
fix it within a reasonable time. If the landlord causes any damage
when they are carrying out repairs, the landlord must also repair that
damage.

If the tenant thinks the landlord has failed to make sure the property
meets the Repairing Standard, then the tenant should first contact the
landlord. If the landlord does not sort the problem out, then the tenant
can apply to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal might do one of three things:

It might reject the application; or

It might agree with the tenant and order the landlord to carry out
repairs; or

It might suggest that the dispute could be resolved by both the
tenant and the landlord, perhaps with the help of mediation - which
is a third person meeting with the landlord and tenant to try to find
a way of sorting things out.

If the landlord is ordered to carry out repairs, the order will give them a
reasonable amount of time to carry out the repairs. If they do not do
so, the Tribunal can issue a rent relief order. The rent relief order is an
order reducing the rent the tenant has to pay by an amount not
exceeding 90%. The tenant should not withhold rent without a rent
relief order being issued by the Tribunal.

1.2 Structure & Exterior

The landlord must keep the structure of the building in good repair.

This includes:

drains, gutters and outside pipes;

roof;

outside walls, doors, windowsills, window catches, sash cords, and

window frames;

inside walls, floors, ceilings, doors, door frames, inside stair cases

and landings;

chimneys, chimney stacks, and flues;

pathways, steps or other means of access;

plaster work;

boundary walls and fences.


-----

Sometimes the landlord might be responsible, along with owners of
homes nearby, to keep certain common parts of a building or walls
between two properties in good repair. Examples of this might be
where the property is a flat in a tenement building. In that case the
common parts would usually include items such as the roof, common
doors, the staircase giving access to all flats and the back court area.
The landlord would need to carry out repairs to these things - but this
would be shared with the owners of all of the other flats within the
tenement.

1.3 Gas Safety

If the property has a gas supply, then the landlord must arrange for a
gas safety check to be carried out, by a gas safe registered engineer,
on all gas pipes and appliances (for example fire, hob, oven and
boiler) in the property which have been supplied by the landlord. This
must be done every year.

After each yearly check, the engineer signs a Landlord Gas Safety
Record, which notes the results of the checks and confirms whether
each gas appliance meets the safety standard it needs to.

The landlord must make sure that the property is safe. If the tenant
has any concerns about the safety of any gas item in the property, or
knows that any gas appliances or pipework are not working properly for example, there’s a smell of gas or the pilot light in a boiler does not
stay lit - then the tenant must tell the landlord.

The landlord must give the tenant a copy of each yearly Landlord Gas
Safety Record which is issued by the gas safe registered engineer. If
the landlord does not do this, the tenant can contact the Health &
Safety Executive for advice or can get gas safety advice at
[www.gassaferegister.co.uk. Also, the tenant could contact the local](http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/)
council, which could require the landlord to provide the Record to the
tenant or face losing their registration as a landlord with the local
council.

If a gas engineer decides that any gas appliance is unsafe - which is
often called "condemned" - then the tenant must not use that
appliance.

Carbon monoxide detectors go off (so the alarm sounds) if carbon
monoxide is present in a property. Carbon monoxide is a dangerous
gas which can cause illness or even death. Unlike the gas which
powers the appliances in a property (like the boiler and hob), carbon
monoxide does not have any smell - the only way to know that carbon
monoxide is in a property is by having a carbon monoxide detector.
Because of this, the landlord must have carbon monoxide detectors
installed in the property if there are appliances which use carbon
based fuel - which would be gas, wood, coal, other solid fuel or oil.

A carbon monoxide detector must be in:

each room or inter-connected space such as a garage, that has a
fixed carbon based fuel powered appliance (except one solely


-----

used for cooking) so, for example, every room or inter connected
space that has a fire, heater or a boiler; and

if the flue from any carbon based fuel powered appliance passes
through any bedroom or living room, then in each of those rooms
too.

The Scottish Government guidance about carbon monoxide alarms in
[private rented homes is at https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-monoxide-alarms-in-private-rented-properties-guidance/)
[monoxide-alarms-in-private-rented-properties-guidance/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/carbon-monoxide-alarms-in-private-rented-properties-guidance/)

1.4 Electrical Safety

The landlord must ensure that all electric fittings and items in the
property are in a reasonable state of repair and in proper and safe
working order.

As part of this duty to keep electric fittings and items in a reasonable
state of repair, the landlord must arrange for an electrical safety
inspection to be carried out at least every 5 years. That inspection
must be carried out by a qualified person who then issues two reports:

an Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) on any fixed
installations; and

a Portable Appliance Testing Report (PAT) on moveable
appliances - and the inspector should also stick a label on each
tested item which sets out the inspection date, and each label
should be signed by the inspector.

The landlord must give the tenant copies of both reports.

If the tester says that testing should be more frequent than once every
five years (for example, once every 3 years), then the landlord must
follow this advice.

The EICR must cover:

Installations for the supply of electricity,

Electrical fittings, such as switches, sockets and visible wiring

Visual inspection of fixed electrical equipment such as electric
showers, hard-wired smoke and fire detectors/tamper proof longlife lithium battery alarms and storage or panel heaters.

The PAT covers movable appliances, which are any electrical items
provided by the landlord, that are not fitted or fixed in, but can be
moved about easily. These include appliances like kettles, lamps,
vacuum cleaners, and white goods such as fridges or washing
machines.

The Scottish Government statutory guidance on electrical installations
and appliances in private rented property can be found at
[https://www.gov.scot/publications/electrical-installations-and-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/electrical-installations-and-appliances-private-rented-properties/)
[appliances-private-rented-properties/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/electrical-installations-and-appliances-private-rented-properties/)


-----

1.5 Smoke Detectors and heat alarms

The smoke and heat alarms in the property must be powered by the
electrical mains or be tamper proof long-life lithium battery alarms.

There must be one working smoke alarm in:

    - The room which is most often lived in during the daytime, which

would likely be the living or dining room

    - Every circulation space, such as hallways and landings

    - There must also be a heat alarm in the kitchen.

     - All alarms should be linked (radio-linked alarms are acceptable).

The landlord also needs to make sure that the property is fit and safe
for people to live in. Therefore, the landlord must make sure that
there are no fire hazards in the property, like loose wiring.

If the tenant thinks there are fire risks in the property, then the tenant
should contact the landlord. If the landlord refuses to fit smoke or heat
alarms or to fix any fire risks, the tenant can contact the Tribunal or
contact the local authority's Environmental Health Department.

Guidance on fire detection in private rented properties can be found
at: [https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-private-](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-private-rented-properties/)
[rented-properties/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fire-safety-guidance-private-rented-properties/)

1.6 Installations

Anything which was in the property (or is part of the property) at the
start of the lease is something provided by the landlord. These items
must be kept, by the landlord, in proper working order - and repaired
when needed.

This duty on the landlord does not apply to things brought into the
property by the tenant.

The installations in the Let Property may include the following:

   - basins, sinks, baths, toilets, and showers;

   - gas or electric fires and central heating systems;

   - electrical wiring;

   - door entry systems;

   - cookers;

   - extractor fans;

   - carbon monoxide detectors;

   - smoke alarms;


-----

   - heat detectors;

   - fire extinguishers and blankets (but only if the property is a
House in Multiple Occupation).

1.7 Energy Performance Certificate

Before the tenancy starts, the landlord must give the tenant a copy of
the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for the property if one is
needed. If the tenancy is for renting a room with shared access to
other rooms such as a kitchen, bathroom and living room, an EPC is
not needed.

It is a requirement under law that the EPC must be ‘affixed’ to the
building - it will often be located in the boiler or meter cupboard.

The EPC must not be more than 10 years old. The EPC has to be
made available to a tenant free of charge.

The EPC tells the tenant about the energy efficiency of the property. If
a property is energy efficient, the fuel bills for the person living in the
home (for heating and lighting) will be lower than if the property is not
energy efficient.

The EPC ratings can be A, B, C, D, E, F or G.

An "A" rating on an EPC is the best rating - this would be given to a
home which was very energy efficient and should have low bills for
fuel and lighting.

A "G" rating on an EPC is the worst - so the least energy efficient,
which may have higher bills for fuel and lighting.

1.8 Furnishings

The landlord must make sure that:

all upholstered furniture (like settees, arm chairs and dining chairs
with soft seat coverings) and

all mattresses

which are in the property at the start of the tenancy meet the
standards set out in the Furniture & Furnishings (Fire Safety)
Regulations 1988 as amended so should have labels attached to
them which show that they meet these Regulations.

Tenants should report worn or broken furnishings and coverings to the
landlord as these can make furniture unsafe and present a fire risk.

1.9 Defective Fixtures & Fittings

The landlord must keep all fixtures and fittings in the property at the
start of the tenancy in a good state of repair. This applies, for
example, to fitted kitchen units and fitted wardrobes, toilets, sinks,
baths, showers and fitted kitchen appliances such as hobs and ovens.


-----

The tenant should tell the landlord if any fixtures and fittings need to
be repaired. The landlord must get the repairs done within a
reasonable time.

1.10 Repair Timetable

Often, a landlord will only find out that something in the property is not
working or needs to be repaired when the tenant tells their landlord
about it.

The tenant must tell the landlord as soon as they can about any repair
being needed or if there is something urgent. The landlord then has to
carry out any repairs as soon as they reasonably can.

The tenant must give the landlord reasonable access to get the repair
work done.

What is a reasonable period to carry out repairs will vary depending
on the type of repair which is needed and how dangerous or unsafe it
might be to leave that item not repaired.

If the landlord does not carry out repairs within a reasonable period,
the tenant can ask the Tribunal to order the landlord to carry out these
repairs. Also, for some major repairs or those that cause a safety
issue, the tenant might be able to get the local council to order the
landlord to do the work or the local council might do the work and ask
the landlord to pay the costs. The local council also has powers to
report the landlord to the Tribunal for their failure to meet the
Repairing Standard.

1.11 Payment for Repairs

If damage was caused by the fault or negligence of

the tenant or someone living with the tenant at the property or

someone visiting,

then the tenant is responsible.

This means that the tenant must pay for the damage to be fixed. The
tenant should discuss with the landlord having the repair carried out.
The landlord might prefer to arrange to get the damage fixed and
send a bill for the costs to the tenant.

Damage would be caused by fault if it was done on purpose.

Damage would be caused by negligence if it was not done on purpose
but the person who caused the damage did not take normal care to
avoid the damage. For example, a person is negligent if he leaves a
skylight window open all day when rain is forecast and this results in
the carpet and furnishings in the room below being damaged by the
rain. Another example might be a person causes a burn mark to
appear on a kitchen table by placing a pot, straight from a hot burner
on the cooker hob, onto the table top.


-----

1.12 Information

The tenant will be asked by the landlord to meet the costs of any
repairs and the landlord should supply them with copies of the
receipts for such costs.

The landlord must give the tenant copies of:

the Landlord's Gas Safety Record (Note 17.3 - Gas Safety);

the Electrical Safety Inspection Report and the Portable Appliance
Testing Report (Note 17.4 – Electrical Safety); and

the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for the property (Note
17.7 – Energy Performance Certificate).

These must be given to the tenant before, or at the start of, the
tenancy.

**Legionella**

The landlord must take all reasonable steps to reduce the risk of the presence
of legionella bacteria.

Legionnaires’ disease is caused by legionella bacteria and is a kind of
pneumonia (or lung infection).

The legionella bacteria which causes the disease is sometimes present in cold
or hot water systems in buildings. It is therefore important to try to keep the
risk as low as possible by taking certain steps.

The landlord must carry out a risk assessment.

Simple control measures can help to minimise the risk of exposure to
Legionella. These include:

flushing out a water system before the start of a tenancy - so flushing all

toilets and running water through all cold and hot water taps and
showers for a period of time;

avoiding debris getting into the system - for example by making sure that any

cold water tanks have a tight fitting lid; and

making sure any pipework which is no longer used is removed.

If a property is served directly by mains cold water, then there is only a low
risk of legionella bacteria in the cold water, as it flows from a moving supply,
not from stored water.

If a property is served by hot water:

from a tank which is regularly heated to over 60 degrees centigrade; or

from an instant hot water boiler - which does not store heated water, but heats

it as it is used,


-----

then, again, there is only a low risk of legionella bacteria in the hot water
system.

To keep the risk of legionella bacteria being present in the property low,
tenants:

should not alter the controls on any hot water system in a way which would

increase the legionella risk (for example lowering the regular heat
temperature to below 60 degrees); and

should regularly clean shower heads - as these result in a spray of tiny drops

of water which might be breathed into the lungs.

**Access for Repairs, Inspections and valuations**

The tenant must by law let the landlord (or their workmen or advisers) have
reasonable access onto the property for "authorised purposes".

Authorised purposes are:

carrying out work in the property which the landlord must carry out or is

allowed to carry out, in either case by law or in terms of the tenancy or in
terms of any other agreement between the landlord and the tenant;

checking the property to see whether any work needs to be done - for

example repairs; and

carrying out a valuation of the property.

The tenant should be given at least 48 hours' notice before this happens unless it is an emergency. If it is an emergency, then less than 48 hours'
notice might be given, or immediate access might be needed (with no notice
beforehand). An emergency might include a dangerous electrical fault or a
burst water pipe in the property which is flooding the property or any flat below
it. Emergencies are repairs that are causing danger or, if left, are likely to
cause damage to the property or property nearby if they are not repaired
quickly.

Reasonable access, for non-emergency work, would generally mean access
during the working day (8 a.m. to 6 p.m.) Monday to Friday. If both landlord
and tenant agree, then the tenant could allow access outwith such times if this
would allow work to be done more quickly.

A landlord will usually hold a set of keys for the property. However, unless it is
for an emergency, the landlord is not allowed to use those keys to enter the
property without the tenant's consent.

If the tenant does not give consent then the landlord can apply to the Tribunal
for an order to take access. The Tribunal will try and agree a date for access
with the tenant. If the tenant refuses to agree a date for repairs than the
Tribunal can fix a date when the landlord can enter.

**Respect for Others**

The tenant and anyone living at the property must not be involved in antisocial
behaviour at the property.


-----

Antisocial behaviour means behaving in a way:

which causes, or is likely to cause, alarm, upset, nuisance or annoyance; or

which is harassment.

‘At the property’ includes to other people in the property, any neighbour, any
visitor, the landlord or those acting for the landlord or any tradesman.

Examples of antisocial behaviour are:

making too much noise - including from televisions, CD players, digital media

players, radios and musical instruments, DIY or power tools;

not controlling pets (including allowing them to bark too much) or allowing pets

to foul or cause damage to other people’s property or common areas of
the property such as the garden;

allowing visitors to the property to be too noisy;

vandalising or damaging the property or any part of the common areas or

neighbourhood;

leaving rubbish other than in the bins provided or leaving rubbish out to be

picked up on a day when it is not due to be picked up;

allowing the tenant and/or any other person (including children) living in or

using the property to cause a nuisance or annoyance to other people;

harassing any other tenant or occupier, visitors, neighbours, family members

of the landlord or employees of the landlord or agent, or any other
person or persons in the house, or neighbourhood, for whatever reason.
This includes behaviour due to that person’s race, colour or ethnic origin,
nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, age, religion or other belief, or
other status;

using or carrying weapons;

using, selling, growing, making or supplying unlawful drugs or selling alcohol;

storing or bringing onto the property any type of unlicensed firearm or firearm

ammunition including any replica or decommissioned firearms;

using the property, or allowing it to be used, for illegal or immoral purposes 
an example of an illegal purpose might be for carrying on a business for
which local council consents have not been obtained; and

threatening or assaulting any other tenant or occupier, visitors, neighbours,

family members of the landlord or employees of the landlord or agent, or
any other person or persons in the house, or neighbourhood, for
whatever reason.

The above list of examples does not include every sort of antisocial behaviour.
There could be other actions, failures to act or words spoken (or shouted)
which would amount to antisocial behaviour.


-----

The landlord can take action against the tenant if there is a breach of the
antisocial behaviour clause in the tenancy.

Landlords have a responsibility to try to stop antisocial behaviour taking place.
So if the tenant is involved in antisocial behaviour the landlord must do
something to try to stop it. This could include:

investigating complaints about the tenant's behaviour;

writing to the tenant to explain that the behaviour is causing concern and

asking the tenant to stop the behaviour;

giving advice on how to reduce noise to an acceptable level;

asking the local council to apply for an Antisocial Behaviour Order or ASBO

against the tenant;

going to court to get an order of the court (called an "interdict") to stop the

tenant from behaving in a certain way; and

warning the tenant that they may be removed from the property if they do not

stop the antisocial behaviour.

If the landlord's attempts to deal with antisocial behaviour do not work, the

landlord can ask the local council to step in to assist. If the antisocial
behaviour continues, the landlord may begin the process to evict the tenant.

If a landlord does not try to stop the antisocial behaviour, the local council can

serve an Antisocial Behaviour Notice on the landlord ordering the landlord to
take action to deal with the problem, for example to evict the tenant, or at least
warn the tenant that they may be evicted if they continue to behave in that
way.

If the landlord does not do what the local council's Antisocial Behaviour Notice

says, then the local council can ask the Court to stop rent payments to the
landlord or to give the local council control of the property.

If a tenant is affected by other people's antisocial behaviour, the tenant should

keep a written record of what happens, each time it happens, with dates and
times. Depending on how bad things are, the tenant should contact:

the nearest Citizens' Advice Bureau or the Antisocial Behaviour team at the

local authority - both of which can give the tenant advice on the tenant's
rights and what might be the best action for the tenant to take (which
could be to contact the police); or

the local authority’s antisocial behaviour team; or

the police - who can take action to stop certain behaviours.

**Equality Requirements**

Under the Equality Act 2010, the landlord is not allowed to show bias against
a tenant, or against a person who wants to become a tenant of a property, on
the basis of:

that person's disability sex or gender reassignment; or


-----

that person s pregnancy or the fact that the person has a baby or babies or

child or children; or

that person's race, religion or belief or sexual orientation.

If a tenant thinks they have been unfairly treated by a landlord because of a
protected characteristic, then the tenant can:

complain directly to the landlord; or

in some cases to make a claim through the Tribunal, if for example an

Agreement contains a discriminatory clause that the Tribunal could
remove or if that discrimination led to an unfair rent or unlawful eviction;
or

contact the Equality Advisory Support Service for help and advice.

[https://www.gov.uk/equality-advisory-support-service](https://www.gov.uk/equality-advisory-support-service)

**Data Protection**

The landlord must comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws
to ensure that the tenant's personal data is held securely and only disclosed
where there is a lawful basis for doing so.

“Data Protection Laws” means any law, statute, subordinate
legislation, regulation, order, mandatory guidance or code of practice,
judgment of a relevant court of law, or directives or requirements of any
regulatory body which relates to the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of Personal Data to which a Party is subject
including the Data Protection Act 2018 and any statutory modification
or re-enactment thereof and the GDPR.

“GDPR” means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC.

Under data protection law, "personal data" is protected.

Landlords need to comply with the following requirements regarding personal
data:

Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to
individuals (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be
incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);

(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);


-----

(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step
must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard
to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without
delay (‘accuracy’);

(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer
than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to
implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures
required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of
individuals (‘storage limitation’);

(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal
data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and
against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or
organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).

Landlords might need to give tenants a privacy notice to tell them what can be
done with data which they hold and how they might use it.

There are some situations where the landlord can disclose data about the
tenant.

For example, they are allowed to give the tenant's details to the local council
or utility companies if that is covered by a privacy notice issued by the
landlord to the tenant.

**Ending the Agreement**

This section details the ending of the Agreement by the landlord or the tenant.

**Tenant ending the Agreement**

The tenant can end the tenancy at any time by giving written notice to the
landlord. That written notice must say that:

the tenant wants to end the tenancy and

the date on which the tenancy is to end.

(If it is a joint tenancy, all of the tenants must give the notice, not just one or
some of them. See more detail later in this section.)

The tenant's notice must be given to the landlord 28 days (or 4 weeks)
**before the date on which the tenant wants the tenancy to end.**

If the tenant gives the notice to the landlord by hand (it is good practice to
have proof this happened e.g. having a witness, a signing receipt or
photograph of signature), then the notice would have to be given 28 days (or 4
weeks) before the date on which the tenant wants the tenancy to end.


-----

If the tenant:
posts the notice or

sends the notice by email (if this is allowed - see Note 4 – Communication),

then the notice would have to be posted or emailed at least 30 days before
the date on which the tenant wants the tenancy to end. This allows time for
the notice to be received by the landlord. (See Note 4)

If the tenant wants to end the tenancy sooner than 28 days, they may be
able to agree this with their landlord. This landlord’s agreement must be in
writing. If the landlord does not agree, the tenancy will continue for the
**minimum 28 day period even if they move out of the property sooner.**

If the Agreement is a joint tenancy then all of the joint tenants have to agree
to the ending of the Agreement. One joint tenant cannot end the Agreement
on behalf of all tenants. Any notice from the tenant to end the tenancy would
have to be signed by all of the joint tenants.

If a joint tenant wants to end the tenancy by sending notice to the landlord by
email then this would be done either:

by each of the people who are joint tenants sending their own email to the

landlord, all saying that the tenancy is to end on the same date; or

by each of the joint tenants signing a paper copy notice to the landlord and

then one of those joint tenants scanning or taking a photo of that signed
paper copy notice and attaching it to an email and emailing it to the
landlord, on behalf of all of the joint tenants.

There are times, such as where there has been domestic violence, where a
court can make an exclusion order or order the transfer of a joint tenancy into
the name of one tenant, or a tenancy in the name of one partner into the
name of the other. This is under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection)
(Scotland) Act 1981 or the Civil Partnership Act 2004. If a tenant needs advice
about this, they could contact one of the advice groups listed at the end of
[these Notes or Scottish Women's Aid (http://womensaid.scot)](http://womensaid.scot/)

**Landlord ending the Agreement**

The landlord can also end the tenancy by written notice to the tenant. This
written notice is called a Notice to Leave. The landlord cannot simply end the
tenancy because the landlord wants the tenancy to end. The landlord can
**only end the tenancy by giving Notice to Leave on one or more of the 18**
**grounds.**

##### Notice periods from 30 March 2022 onwards 

**All eviction grounds are discretionary. This means that the First-tier**
**Tribunal (Housing and Property Chamber) can exercise discretion and**
**take account all circumstances of a case when deciding whether or not**
**to grant an eviction.**

**Landlord ending the Agreement**


-----

The landlord can also end the tenancy by written notice to the tenant. This
written notice is called a Notice to Leave.  The landlord cannot simply end
the tenancy because the landlord wants the tenancy to end. The landlord
**can only end the tenancy by giving Notice to Leave on one or more of**
**the 18 grounds which are set out below.**

The minimum period of notice which the landlord must give the tenant
**will be 28 days (4 weeks) but the tenant may be entitled to 84 days’ (12**
**weeks’) notice depending on how long they have been living in the property**
and what ground is being used to remove the tenant - see below for more
detail.

The landlord's written notice to the tenant, ending the tenancy, must say:

which one or more of the 18 grounds is the reason why the landlord is ending

the tenancy;

why the landlord thinks that ground applies; and

the date on which the landlord expects to become entitled to make an

application for an eviction order to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland
Housing and Property Chamber.

The landlord should provide the tenant with a copy of any supporting evidence
for the eviction ground when they serve the Notice to Leave on the Tenant.

The tenancy end date will be set out in the Notice to Leave.  There are four
possible options for the tenant:
1. The tenant could choose to leave on the date in the Notice to Leave.

2. Despite the date set out in the notice, the tenant may ask the landlord to

agree to a later date, in which case the tenancy will end on that date - this is
only if the landlord agrees.

3. If the tenant believes that the ground(s) for ending the Agreement given in the

notice do not apply, then they should discuss this with the landlord and also
contact the advice groups listed at the end of these Notes.

4. The other option would be for the tenant to wait for the landlord to apply to the

Tribunal for an Eviction Order, as at that stage the landlord will be asked by
the Tribunal to prove that the ground(s) specified for eviction do apply. The
tenant does not need to move out until an Eviction Order is granted by the
Tribunal.

**Where the Tenant chooses not to leave**

If the tenant does not leave the property on the tenancy end date, the landlord
can apply to the Tribunal to get an order to evict the tenant. The tenancy then
ends on the date set out in that eviction order.

If the landlord applies to the Tribunal for an eviction order, the Tribunal will ask
the landlord to prove to the Tribunal why the ground set out in the landlord's
notice applies to allow the landlord to end the tenancy.


-----

**Amount of notice**

All tenants are entitled to receive 28 days’ notice.  Some tenants will be able
to get 84 days’ notice.

The amount of notice which the landlord has to give the tenant depends on:

which of the 18 eviction ground(s) the landlord is using to end the Agreement;

and

how long the tenant has lived in the property.

**28 days' (or 4 weeks') notice must be given to the tenant if:**

on the date that the tenant receives the Notice to Leave, the tenancy has

been running for six months or less;

**OR**

the only eviction ground(s) set out in the landlord's notice to leave is/are that

the tenant:

`o` is not occupying the property as the tenant's only or main home;
or

`o` has breached the Agreement; or

`o` is in rent arrears for three or more months in a row; or

`o` has been found guilty, in a court, of certain crimes; or

`o` has been involved in antisocial behaviour; or

`o` has been involved with a person who has been found guilty of
certain crimes or has been involved in antisocial behaviour.

In all other cases, the tenant must get 84 days' (or 12 weeks) notice.

**84 days' (or 12 weeks) notice must be given to the tenant if:**

on the date that the tenant receives the landlord's notice, the tenancy has

been running for more than six months;

**AND**

the landlord's notice includes any of the eviction ground(s) not mentioned

above.

##### Notice periods from 1 April 2021 to 29 March 2022

**All eviction grounds are discretionary. This means that the First-tier**
**Tribunal (Housing and Property Chamber) can exercise discretion and**
**take account all circumstances of a case when deciding whether or not**
**to grant an eviction.**


-----

**The minimum period of notice which the landlord must give the tenant**
**while the COVID-19 emergency procedures remain in force (up to and**
**including 29[th] March 2022) will be either 6 months or 3 months’ or 28**
**days depending on the ground used. The landlord's written notice to the**
tenant, ending the tenancy, must say:

which one or more of the 18 grounds is the reason why the landlord is ending

the tenancy;

why the landlord thinks that ground applies; and

the date on which the landlord expects to become entitled to make an

application for an eviction order to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland
Housing and Property Chamber.

The landlord should provide the tenant with a copy of any supporting evidence
for the eviction ground when they serve the Notice to Leave on the Tenant.

The tenancy end date will be set out in the Notice to Leave. There are four
possible options for the tenant:
1. The tenant could choose to leave on the date in the Notice to Leave.

2. Despite the date set out in the notice, the tenant may ask the landlord

to agree to a later date, in which case the tenancy will end on that date

    - this is only if the landlord agrees.

3. If the tenant believes that the ground(s) for ending the Agreement given

in the notice do not apply, then they should discuss this with the
landlord and also contact the advice groups listed at the end of these
Notes.

**4. The other option would be for the tenant to wait for the landlord to**

**apply to the Tribunal for an Eviction Order, as at that stage the**
**landlord will be asked by the Tribunal to prove that the ground(s)**
**specified for eviction do apply. The tenant does not need to move**
**out until an Eviction Order is granted by the Tribunal.**

**Where the Tenant chooses not to leave**

If the tenant does not leave the property on the tenancy end date, the landlord
can apply to the Tribunal to get an order to evict the tenant. The tenancy then
ends on the date set out in that eviction order.

If the landlord applies to the Tribunal for an eviction order, the Tribunal will ask
the landlord to prove to the Tribunal why the ground set out in the landlord's
notice applies to allow the landlord to end the tenancy.

**Amount of notice**

The amount of notice your Landlord must give you will depend on the eviction
ground used. The notice period which must be given while the COVID-19
emergency procedures remain in force (up until 30[th] March 2022) will either be
6 months, 3 months or 28 days. Details of the amount of notice that your
landlord must give you for each ground are detailed below:


-----

**There are 18 grounds that allow a landlord to end a tenancy**

More detail on the 18 grounds is given below.

**1. Landlord intends to sell the let property**
This ground applies if your landlord plans on putting the property up for sale
within three months of you moving out.
They'll need evidence to prove it – this could include a letter from a solicitor or
an estate agent, or a recent home report for the property.


-----

**2. Let property to be sold by lender**
This ground applies if your landlord's mortgage lender wants to repossess the
property and sell it.

**3. Landlord intends to refurbish the let property**
This ground applies if your landlord wants to carry out major works to the let
property that are so disruptive you wouldn't be able to live there at the same
time.
Example of evidence could include planning permission, or a contract
between your landlord and an architect or a builder for the work to be carried
out.

**4. Landlord intends to live in the let property**
This ground applies if your landlord wants you to move out of the property so
they can move in. Evidence could include an affidavit (a written statement,
signed under oath in the presence of a Notary Public or a Justice of the
Peace, that can be used as evidence at the Tribunal) saying this is what they
are going to do.

**5. Landlord intends to use the let property for non-residential purpose**
This ground applies if your landlord wants you to move out so they can use
the property for something other than a home. Evidence could include
planning permission that will let them use the property for a different purpose.

**6. Let property required for religious worker**
This ground applies if the property is held to be available for someone who
has a religious job (like a priest, nun, monk, imam, lay missionary, minister,
rabbi or something similar). he ground only works if the property has been
used for this purpose before.

**7. Tenant has a relevant criminal conviction**
This ground applies if you're convicted of an offence punishable by
imprisonment that involved you either:

 - using the property for illegal reasons

 - letting someone use the property for illegal reasons

 - committing a crime within or near the property
Your landlord has to apply to the Tribunal within a year of you being
convicted, unless they have a reasonable excuse for not applying before then.

**8. Tenant is no longer occupying the let property**
This ground applies if the property isn't being used as your main or only
home. This doesn't count if your landlord failed their duty to keep the property
in good repair and you had to move out for your own safety.

**9. Landlord's family member intends to live in the let property**
This ground applies if a member of your landlord's family plans to move into
the property as their only or main home for at least three months.

Members of your landlord's family who qualify for this are:

 - their spouse

 - their civil partner

 - someone living with them as though they were married to them

 - a parent or grandparent

 - a child or grandchild

- a brother or sister


-----

 - step or half relatives (like a stepson or half sister)

 - a person being treated as someone's child even if they aren't related

biologically or legally

 - any family member (as listed above) of your landlord's spouse, civil

partner or person living with them as though they were married

 - the spouse or civil partner of any family members listed above, or

someone living with them as though they were married
Your landlord will need evidence for this ground. This could include an
affidavit stating that this is what their family member intends to do.

**10. Tenant no longer needs supported accommodation**
This ground applies if you moved into the property because you had a need
for community care and you've since been assessed as no longer having that
need.

**11. Tenant has breached a term of the tenancy agreement**
This ground applies if you haven't complied with one of the terms of tenancy.
This doesn't apply to cases where you haven't paid your rent (known as 'rent
arrears') – there's a separate ground for this.

**12. Tenant has engaged in relevant antisocial behaviour**
This ground applies if you've behaved in an antisocial way to another person,
by doing something which either:

 - causes them alarm or distress

 - is a nuisance or annoyance

 - is considered harassment

The First-tier Tribunal will consider the behaviour, who it involved and where it
occurred to decide whether to issue an eviction order.
To use this ground, your landlord has to apply to the Tribunal within a year of
the behaviour taking place, unless they have a reasonable excuse. 15

**13. Tenant has associated in the let property with someone who has a**
**criminal conviction or is antisocial**
This ground applies if you allow someone into the property and they behave in
an antisocial way that would have them evicted if they were the tenant.
This person could be:

 - a sub-tenant

 - your lodger

 - someone you let into the property on more than one occasion

To use this ground, your landlord has to apply to the Tribunal within a year of
the conviction or behaviour taking place, unless they have a reasonable
excuse.

**14. Landlord has had their registration refused or revoked**
This ground applies if your landlord isn't registered as a landlord in the local
council area where the property is located.
This could be because the local council has either:

 - refused to enter them in the register

 - removed them from the register

**15. Landlord's HMO licence has been revoked**


-----

This ground applies if the HMO (House of Multiple Occupancy) licence for the
property has been removed and keeping all the tenants in the property would
no longer be legal.

**16. An overcrowding statutory notice has been served on the landlord**
This ground applies if an 'overcrowding statutory notice' has been served on
your landlord because the property is overcrowded to the extent that it may
affect the health of the people living there.

**17. Tenant is in rent arrears over three consecutive months**
This ground applies if you've been in 'rent arrears' (owed rent payments) for
three or more months in a row.

In deciding whether it is reasonable to evict, the Tribunal will consider whether
you being in arrears is due to a delay or failure in the payment of a relevant
benefit.

**18. Tenant has stopped being — or has failed to become — an employee**
This ground applies if your landlord let you move in because you were their
employee (or were going to be one), and now you aren't.

**Unlawful Eviction**

If the landlord tries physically or by force to remove a tenant from the property
without the Tribunal’s permission, the landlord is committing a crime. If the
landlord physically removes the tenant from the property, or threatens to do
so, or if the landlord changes the locks, the tenant should report the matter to
the police. (The non-emergency number to contact the police is 101.)

For an eviction to be lawful (so allowed by law), after the Landlord obtains the
eviction order from the Tribunal, the eviction (or removal of the tenant from the
property) must be done by Sheriff Officers, not by the landlord or by the
landlord's employees or agents.

The law protects the tenant against harassment and unlawful eviction in two
ways:

by making harassment and unlawful eviction crimes; and

by allowing the tenant to claim damages (ask for money) through the courts.

The law against harassment applies if the landlord personally harasses or
evicts the tenant unlawfully or if somebody else does it for the landlord.

**Wrongful Termination Orders**

If the tenant has left the property and thinks they have been misled into
leaving the property, they can apply to the Tribunal for a 'wrongful termination
order'. The Tribunal may make a wrongful termination order if it decides that
the landlord:

misled the Tribunal into giving an eviction order it should not have

misled the tenant into leaving the property.


-----

An example of a possible wrongful termination would be where the landlord

serves notice to leave on the tenant on the ground that they intend to sell the
property, but then takes no action to do so, and simply lets it out to another
tenant.

If a wrongful termination order is issued, the landlord will be told to pay the
tenant a payment of no more than six months' rent.  The local council will also
be told about the order being made and will take this into account when
deciding if the landlord is (or remains) a "fit and proper" person registered to
be a landlord.

**Tenant's belongings to be removed**

The tenant must remove the tenant's belongings when the tenancy ends.
This will include everything that the tenant has brought into the property.

If the tenant leaves items behind, and the landlord then has to spend money
removing them or storing them, then the tenant will have to pay the costs of
removal or storage.

The landlord should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts for such
costs.

**Contents and Condition**

The tenant will likely be asked to sign an Inventory and Record of Condition
("Inventory") and if so this should be attached to the Agreement or given to
the tenant before or at the start of the tenancy. A copy of this should be kept
by both the landlord and the tenant.

This Inventory should be a full and detailed record of the contents and
condition of the property at the start of the tenancy.

   - The inventory part is a list of everything in the property being rented, for

example, the furniture, carpets and curtains and all the items in the kitchen
(as well as the condition of all of these items - so, for example, whether they
have any damage to them or marks on them).

   - The record of condition part should set out the state of the property itself - and

so should, for example, say whether any parts have chips or marks or stains
or are broken. This part of the inventory can include pictures to help show the
condition of items.

The Inventory can help to avoid a dispute over the deposit at the end of the tenancy because it proves the state that the property and its contents were in at the start of
the tenancy. If the landlord or letting agent does not give the tenant the Inventory
before the start of the tenancy, the tenant should ask for it. The tenant should:
  - Check the Inventory before signing it and make a note of anything damaged,

broken, or worn-out. This checking includes making sure that everything in the
property is listed on the Inventory and that it is does not list items which
cannot be found in the property.

  - Make sure that the tenant and the landlord sign the Inventory once both agree

that it is correct.

   - If the tenant is concerned that the Inventory does not fully describe any

marks, stains, chips or other faults in the property, then the tenant could also


-----

take photos on the day that the tenant moves in and send copies of those to
the landlord right away. Unless the photos are sent as soon as the tenant
moves in, they might not be able to be used as evidence (unless the tenant's
camera shows, on each photo, the date on which the photo was taken).

  - Store the tenant's copy of the signed Inventory and any photos taken by the

tenant at the start of the tenancy in a place where they can be found later.
They might be needed for evidence if there is an dispute about the amount of
the deposit which should be returned at the end of the tenancy.

The tenant has 7 days after the start of the tenancy to make sure that the Inventory
is correct.

If, within those 7 days, the tenant tells the landlord, in writing, of anything the tenant
does not agree with, then the Inventory should be changed to reflect an item’s true
state.

If the tenant does nothing, then at the end of those 7 days, the Inventory is treated
as if it had been approved by the tenant - even if the tenant does not sign it.

If the tenant (or someone in the tenant's family or visiting the property) damages any
part of the property or any of the contents, then the tenant must repair or replace the
damaged part. This does not apply to any damage which is simply due to normal use
of the property and its contents - often called normal wear and tear. (See Note 17 –
Reasonable Care)
**Local Council Taxes/Charges**

The tenant must tell the local council and utility companies that Council Tax,
water and sewerage charges should be in the tenant’s name. The landlord
may also do so. The tenant will have to pay the Council Tax, water and
sewerage charges unless the tenant is exempt for any reason. For example, if
the tenancy states the rent includes such charges, or if full time students live
in the property, Council Tax may not need to be paid. A tenant living alone
can also apply to the Council to receive a discount on their Council Tax.

The tenant must tell the local council when the tenancy starts and then when it
ends.

If the tenant thinks that he or she doesn’t need to pay Council tax or other
charges, the tenant needs to apply to the local council Revenues & Benefits
department to get an exemption. It will not be given without the tenant making
the application.
**Utilities**

The tenant must make sure that the accounts for gas / electricity / telephone /
TV licence / internet / broadband are all in the tenant's name with the
companies which supply those services. All of these services are generally
known as utilities.

The tenant must pay, when due, all charges for utilities and services supplied
during the tenancy. The tenant also has to settle up at the end of the tenancy
for all outstanding amounts.

If there are any bills for utilities left unpaid at the end of the tenancy, the
landlord may be able to use money held in the deposit to settle these bills.


-----

The tenant can change supplier for gas or electricity if they are paying the
supplier and not paying the landlord for utility costs. If the tenant has a prepayment meter, the tenant is still allowed to change supplier and there is no
need to get the landlord's consent first. The tenant must tell the landlord if the
tenant changes supplier and give the landlord the details of the new supplier including its name.

If the tenant permits any electricity or gas meter to be changed from or to a
pre-payment meter, then the tenant also has to pay the direct cost of changing
the meter back at the end of the tenancy (unless the landlord wants to keep
the meter the tenant had put in). So, although the landlord's permission is not
needed to change the meter, the tenant might need to pay the cost of
changing it back if the landlord wants this done.
**Alterations**

The tenant needs to get the landlord's written consent, in advance, before the
tenant does any of the following:

   - makes any alterations to the property;

   - makes any changes to the fixtures and fittings in the property - for example to

the kitchen cupboards or bathroom fittings; or

   - does any internal or external decorating or redecorating - including changing

the colour of any of the walls or ceilings, doors or window frames in the
property.

It's entirely up to the landlord whether or not the landlord agrees to any of these
things being done.

The landlord cannot unreasonably refuse any request by the tenant for adaptions,
auxiliary aids or services under section 52 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 or
section 37 of the Equality Act 2010. Any such request by the tenant must be made in
writing to the landlord. Or, if the work would include or relate to any common parts of
the building (for example a common entrance or common stair), the request must be
made in writing to the persons who own those common parts. The owners of
common parts would usually be all owners of any properties within a building.

For these types of alterations, the landlord or other person owning common parts, is
not entitled unreasonably to refuse to agree to the adaptations being done, auxiliary
aids being installed or services being provided. If consent is refused, the tenant can
appeal to the Tribunal (if the application is made under the Housing (Scotland) Act
2006) or to the Sheriff Court (if the application is made under the Equality Act 2010)
within 6 months after the refusal.

The tenant might find it helpful first to discuss the tenant's needs with the Citizens
Advice Bureau, Shelter Scotland or the local council. Any of these three groups
might agree to talk to the landlord to remind the landlord that the landlord must not
unreasonably refuse consent.
**Common Parts**

If the property is a flat or has common parts that are shared with other
tenants, the tenant must, along with the other owners and occupiers:

  - sweep and clean the common stairway; and

  - keep the garden, back green or any other shared areas clean and tidy.


-----

If the tenant does not do this, then the landlord can arrange for those things to be
done and ask the tenant to pay back the costs. The landlord should supply the
tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
**Roof**

The tenant must not go onto the roof without first getting the landlord's written
consent - unless it's an emergency, in which case the landlord's consent is not
needed.
**Bins and Recycling**

The tenant must dispose of or recycle all rubbish in the correct way.

If rubbish is picked up from the street, then on the day it is due to be collected,
it should be put out before the time asked for by the local council. Any rubbish
and recycling containers should be returned to their normal storage places as
soon as possible after being emptied by the local council.

The tenant must also comply with the local council’s rules if they need to
dispose of large items. Sometimes a local council might charge an extra cost
to uplift a large item. The tenant can also arrange to dispose of large items by
taking them to the nearest recycling centre run by the local council. Details of
how to recycle large items and days and times of refuse and recycling
collections will be given on the local council's website for the area in which the
property is located.

If the tenant does not dispose of rubbish properly, the landlord can do it
instead and ask the tenant to pay back the costs. The landlord should supply
the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
**Storage**

No items belonging to the tenant (or belonging to anyone living with the tenant
or to a visitor) should be left or stored in a common stair - if that would be a
fire or safety hazard or a nuisance to the neighbours.
**Dangerous Substances – including liquid petroleum gas**

The tenant must safely store any petrol and/or gas, including liquid petroleum
gas, which the tenant uses for garden appliances, barbecues or other
household goods or appliances. This means keeping it outside the property if
possible (for example in a shed in the garden) and stored in leak proof and fire
proof containers.

The tenant must not store or keep any other flammable liquids, explosives, or
explosive gases which might be thought to be a fire hazard or dangerous in
the property or in any store, shed or garage.
**Pets**

The tenant needs to get the written consent of the landlord, in advance, before
the tenant brings any animal or pet into the property. It's up to the landlord
whether or not the landlord gives this consent.

If the Agreement bans pets, a tenant can ask the landlord to change it to allow
an assistance dog if the tenant is disabled and needs an assistance dog to be
able to live in the property. If the landlord refuses, they may be discriminating
on the grounds of disability and could be acting illegally.


-----

If the landlord does agree that the tenant can keep an animal or pet in the
property, the tenant must make sure that the animal or pet is kept under
supervision and control. This is to ensure that the pet does not cause damage
to the property or common areas and is not a nuisance to neighbours or
others in the area.

If the landlord agrees to allow a pet then they might request an additional
deposit on top of the deposit they would usually charge. This is to
acknowledge the greater potential for damage and costs at the end of the
tenancy. The total amount of the deposit paid by the tenant, including this
extra deposit cannot be more than 2 months' rent.

At the end of the Agreement, the landlord can ask the tenant to repay the cost
of any damage caused by, or cleaning required due to, a pet. The landlord
should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
**Smoking**

If the tenant wants to smoke in the property (or allow others to smoke in the
property) the tenant must get the landlord's written consent, in advance. This
applies to tobacco smoking or the smoking of anything else.

The tenant must not smoke (or allow others to smoke) in stairwells or other
common areas.

If the tenant is not supposed to smoke in the property then at the end of the
Agreement, the landlord can ask the tenant to repay the cost of any damage
caused by, or cleaning required due to, smoking. The landlord should supply
the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
**Additional Tenancy Terms**

The Agreement might include further clause(s) which the landlord agrees with
the tenant.

Any such other clause cannot go against, or say something different from, any
other clauses in the Agreement which are mandatory clauses.

The mandatory clauses in the agreement appear in bold type (which is darker
than the normal typed wording).

**The Guarantor**

The guarantee clause includes a space for the guarantor's name as well as
the guarantor's address and for the guarantor to sign the Agreement. These
should all be filled in if a guarantor is needed.

A guarantor is not always asked for by a landlord but it is quite common for
the landlord to ask for a guarantor, if the tenant has a low credit score or is
thought to be a higher credit risk, such as if the tenant claims benefits.

The guarantor (if any) agrees to meet the full demands of the tenancy, on the
tenant's behalf, if the tenant does not comply with those rules.

Parents of young people or students are often asked to be guarantors. Joint
residential tenancies have joint and several liability and so the guarantor is
guaranteeing all the joint tenants and not just one particular tenant. The
guarantor might have to pay costs which were due to another joint tenant(s)


-----

not having paid rent or causing damage to the property. These costs can
include legal costs in trying to get payment of the rent arrears or other costs.

If the tenant does not do something which they should, or does something that
they should not do, the landlord can get the guarantor to do what is required
or to meet any costs of fixing what should not have been done.

For example, if the tenant does not pay rent or some other payment due
under the tenancy, the landlord can claim it from the guarantor instead.

Also, if the tenant does not repair some damage to the property which was
caused by the tenant, the landlord can ask the guarantor to repair the damage

    - or the landlord can do the repair themselves and then claim the cost from the
tenant or from the guarantor.

Also if the landlord:

spends money or does work that the tenant should have done; or

pays other people, for example, lawyers and Sheriff Officers, to take action

against the tenant to try to get the tenant to comply with their duties
under the tenancy,

then the landlord can also claim those costs from the guarantor.

The guarantor's liability continues after the tenancy ends - to cover any duties
breached during the tenancy where the costs are still due to be paid.

**Declarations**

This clause includes confirmation (or agreement) by the tenant that, when the
tenant signs the Agreement, the tenant has:

given the landlord or letting agent all information sought by the landlord or

letting agent in connection with the Agreement - without concealing or
hiding anything;

not deliberately or carelessly said or written anything which is untrue or

misleading which might have affected the landlord's decision to enter
into the Agreement; and

read and understood all of the terms of the Agreement including the legal

commentary.

You and your landlord can agree to ‘sign’ the tenancy agreement by

typing your names in the electronic document and sending it by
email if you want to. If you and your landlord don’t want to do this,
you can agree to sign a paper copy of the tenancy agreement
instead.
